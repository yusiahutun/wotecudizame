Otherwise known as the Milwaukee Cannibal, Dahmer managed to elude capture for 13 years after <a href=# rel=noopener>his first victim</a>, Steven Hicks, in 1978.

Dahmer was beaten to death by a fellow inmate, Christopher Scarver, on November 28, 1994. Both men were housed at the Columbia Correctional Facility in Wisconsin. Wisconsin was the first to abolish the death penalty in 1853 hence, despite his abhorrent crimes, Dahmer didn’t receive the death penalty (though he wished for his death. More on that later). Scarver, who was himself serving a 25-year-sentence for an armed robbery-turned-murder, arrived at the prison at around the same time as Dahmer in 1992. The serial killer’s safety was a major concern <a href=# rel=noopener>for prison staff</a>. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> reported at the time that Dahmer had spent his first year in prison under protective isolation. As the state’s most notorious murderers, authorities believed killing him might earn a convict an “honored place in the prison world.” Later authorities deemed it safe for him to be integrated into the population of 622 inmates. In July 1992, an attempt on Dahmer’s life was made. An inmate took a homemade plastic knife and unsuccessfully tried to slash Dahmer’s throat. No one was hurt and prison staff believed it would be an isolated incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jeffrey-dahmer-3.png><p>Dahmer was known to upset his fellow inmates. According to Scarver, the serial killer would taunt other inmates with prison food he fashioned to look like severed limbs, drizzling on packets of ketchup to look like blood. “He would put them in places where people would be,” Scarver told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Post</a> in 2015. “He crossed the line with some people—prisoners, prison staff. Some people who are in prison are repentant—but he was not one of them.”</p><p>Because of Dahmer’s behavior, Scarver tried to steer clear of him but always kept a news clipping in his pocket detailing the cannibal’s crimes. When Scarver suspected Dahmer had prodded him in the back, Scarver snapped. He grabbed a metal bar from the weight room and confronted Dahmer <a href=# rel=noopener>about his crimes</a>. “I asked him if he did those things ’cause I was fiercely disgusted. He was shocked. Yes, he was,” Scarver told the Post. “He started looking for the door pretty quick. I blocked him.” Two swings of the bar to Dahmer’s head were all it took. His skull was crushed and Dahmer was pronounced dead an hour after arriving at the hospital. He was 34. “He ended up dead. I put his head down,” Scarver said of the slaying.</p><p>Rita Isbell, the sister of Errol Lindsey, one of Dahmer’s last victims, said she had anticipated Dahmer’s slaying in prison. The New York Times reported that for two years, she had received phone calls from men claiming to be prison inmates promising Dahmer would “be taken care of.” She said the callers told her: “You don’t know me. I’m up here with Jeffrey Dahmer. Don’t worry. We’ll take care of it.” She continued, “I wouldn’t say I wanted it to happen like this, but Jeffrey tore my family up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jeffrey-dahmer-2.png><h2>How was Jeffrey Dahmer caught?</h2><p>Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested on July 22, 1991, after approaching three men with $100 for them to pose for nude photographs. 32-year-old Tracy Edwards agreed and upon reaching Dahmer’s apartment, he noticed a foul odor and boxed of hydrochloric acid which Dahmer said was for cleaning. Dahmer attempted to handcuff Edwards’ wrists together but only managed to secure one and brandished a knife telling him to pose nude. After five terrifying hours, Edwards managed to escape by pretending to need to go to the bathroom and, when Dahmer’s guard was down, punched him causing the serial killer to lose his balance. Edwards flagged down two police officers, telling them a “freak” pulled a knife on him. Edwards accompanied the officers back to Dahmer’s apartment where they discovered Polaroids of human bodies in the bedroom and severed heads in the refrigerator. “These are for real,” one officer said, showing the photos to the other. When Dahmer saw what the officer was holding, he attacked them and tried to <a href=# rel=noopener>resist arrest</a>, but Dahmer was overpowered. As he was pinned to the floor, he’s said to have uttered the words: “For what I did I should be dead.”</p><p>Upon a more extensive search of Dahmer’s apartment, a team of Milwaukee’s Criminal Investigation Bureau discovered four severed heads in the kitchen, seven skulls in Dahmer’s bedroom, blood drippings in the refrigerator plus two human hearts. There was also a whole torso in his freezer and a myriad of other gruesome discoveries. “It was more like dismantling someone’s museum than an actual crime scene,” the chief medical examiner <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">observed at the time</a>.</p><h2>Jeffrey Dahmer’s confession</h2><p>Jeffrey Dahmer confessed to seducing, killing and dismembering 17 young men and boys. There are over 60 hours of police interviews with Dahmer after his arrest, and the serial killer waived his right to have an attorney present throughout the interrogations. In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Inside Edition</a> in 1993, Dahmer didn’t hesitate in explaining why he did what he did. “I had these obsessive desires and thoughts wanting to control [my victims], to, I don’t know how to put it, possess them permanently,” he said. “And that’s why you killed them,” the reporter asked. “Right, not because I was angry with them, not because I hated them but because I wanted to keep them with me. And as my obsession grew, I was saving body parts such as skulls and skeletons.” He continued that his desire to murder and mutilate didn’t “happen overnight” but that his transition to dehumanizing others and seeing them as objects, is something that occurred gradually. Dahmer was eventually diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, psychotic disorder and borderline personality disorder, but was deemed legally sane to face trial.</p><p>During <a href=# rel=noopener>Dahmer’s sentencing</a> in 1992, Rita Isbell, the sister of Errol Lindsey who was one of the last victims of Dahmer, gave a victim impact statement. The Ryan Murphy-created show Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story recreated the moment on screen and Isbell’s statement word-for-word. “When I saw some of the show, it bothered me, especially when I saw myself — when I saw my name come across the screen and this lady saying verbatim exactly what I said,” she wrote in an essay for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider</a>. “If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve thought it was me. Her hair was like mine, she had on the same clothes. That’s why it felt like reliving it all over again. It brought back all the emotions I was feeling back then.” She also clarified that Netflix did not contact her for the show. “I feel like Netflix should’ve asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. They didn’t ask me anything. They just did it. I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims’ children. … The victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn’t feel so harsh and careless. It’s sad that they’re just making money off of this tragedy. That’s just greed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jeffrey-dahmer-1.png><p>Dahmer had initially pleaded not guilty to 15 <a href=# rel=noopener>counts of murder</a> on September 10, 1991, but changed his plea to guilty but insane in January 1992, which removed the need for a criminal trial but proceedings would focus on his sanity instead. Unlike other criminal trials, a decision did not need to be unanimous. 10 of the 12 jurors would have to agree on the defendant’s mental state for a guilty verdict to stick. “In the case of Dahmer, he admitted that he knew his actions were wrong, so the question became whether or not he was able to control himself,” psychologist Dr. Holly Schiff told <a href=# rel=nofollow>A&E True Crime</a>. By choosing to plead insanity, “Dahmer had the burden to prove to the jurors [since 10 out of 12 must agree] that he was insane at the time of the killings.” For three weeks, jurors heard the details of Dahmer’s depraved crimes and relatives of his victims described their loss. Upon receiving 15 consecutive life sentences, the maximum sentence Judge Laurence C. Gram Jr. of Milwaukee County Circuit Court could give, Dahmer told the court he wished he could be put to death for the “holocaust” for which he was responsible, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Times</a> reported at the time. Thanks to Christopher Scarver, it looks like he got his wish.</p><p>Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and Conversations with a Killer: The Jeffrey Dahmer Tapes are available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jeffrey-Dahmer-A-Terrifying-True-Story-of-Rape-Murder-and-Cannibalism-The-Serial-Killer-Books.jpeg><p>For more about Jeffrey Dahmer, check out Jack Rosewood’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Jeffrey Dahmer: A Terrifying True Story of Rape, Murder & Cannibalism</a>. The biography—which is a part of Rosewood’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Serial Killer Books</a> series—tells the true-crime story of Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer, a serial killer who terrorized Milwaukee, Wisconsin and murdered more than a dozen people (not to mention committed acts of necrophilia and cannibalism) throughout the 1980s until his eventual arrest in 1991. The book explains how Dahmer, who had an above-average intellect and is described as “conventionally good-looking,” was able to fool everyone around him, including his family, his neighbors and the police, to avoid capture for so many years. Jeffrey Dahmer: A Terrifying True Story of Rape, Murder & Cannibalism also takes readers through Dahmer’s murder trial, his death at the hands of his fellow inmates and how his crimes rocked Milwaukee for decades to come.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Watch-This-Space.png alt='"Watch This Space" - Amazon Prime Video' width=670 height=155 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
