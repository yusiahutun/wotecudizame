Chinese businessmen established a number of nam pak hong, or south-north trading houses, to conduct trade with the mainland and Southeastern Asian countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d25b86d8-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>Seafood and Chinese medicine were among the so-called south-north goods shipped in and out of the seaport, although few Hongkongers could afford the lavish ingredients back then, according to Sidney Cheung, an expert in food culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">When having food, Asians look for qualities that are different from what the Westerners likeSidney Cheung</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung says that until around 50 years ago, Des Voeux Road West was known for workshops that produced salted fish from local catches – which were a cheaper, more popular choice for local families. They were gradually replaced by dried seafood retailers as rising incomes fuelled demand for more expensive ingredients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most of the shops also sell dried mushrooms, preserved meats and Chinese medicine products such as gingko seeds and yellow fungus, which are used to make soups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Dried Seafood Street today, vendors are proud that they bring in delicacies from all over the world for Hong Kong’s tables. Households and restaurants each contribute about half of the shops’ sales, vendors say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d11a4340-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>Leung Wing-chiu, 79, started working in the dried seafood business at the age of 14. After spending decades learning from the older generation, he took over Tung Hing Tai Kee, the store founded by his father in 1919.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shop is packed on a recent midweek afternoon as customers choose shrimp and sea cucumbers, feeling and sniffing them to test their quality before putting them in their shopping baskets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung sits behind the counter in the middle of the store, directing his employees and sometimes shouting out answers to queries from visitors above the din.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the shelf behind him, sitting on top of accounting ledgers filled with Chinese calligraphy, are three jars of caterpillar fungi – a traditional medicinal product that is the priciest item in the store – costing about HK$267,000 a kilogram. Also known as cordyceps, they are the fruiting bodies formed after the fungi parasitise ghost moth larvae, and are found in mountainous regions of Tibet and Nepal. Cordyceps are believed to strengthen immunity and restrain development of cancer cells.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The dried seafood items sold here are also beneficial to health, Leung says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Seafood makes you live longer and healthier,” he says, glancing around the shop. “All Cantonese people begin to appreciate that from childhood.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung says that among all the goods he stocks, the “four treasures” – abalone, sea cucumbers, shark fin and fish maw – are traditionally believed to be the most delicious and nutritious.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They have this unique, delicate sea flavour. It is a great pleasure eating them, but you cannot describe it in words.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Passing tourists take photos with curious looks on their faces, mystified by the products on display.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d1c12020-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>There’s abalone, which is believed to improve vision and liver function. The dried sea snails need to be soaked for a few days and are then usually boiled with chicken or pork ribs. They turn out to be chewy and meaty, like the texture of mushrooms, and are best served with oyster sauce. A dozen large abalone from Japan can sell for as much as HK$10,000.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sea cucumbers, thought to have anti-aging effects, should also be soaked and then boiled. The vendors offer a wide range of the species, imported from Japan, South America, Africa and Australia. Ones with the most spike-like papillae are regarded as being of higher quality. The most expensive sea cucumbers sell for about HK$12,000 a kilogram.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Probably the strangest-looking product, batches of yellow discs hanging from the ceiling, are in fact dried swim bladders, or maw. The larger maws in the stores come from fish that are several metres long.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fish maws are often used to make soup, giving it a glutinous texture and a mildly sweet taste. Some restaurants also serve the large ones as a single dish, just like steak, to be eaten with a knife and fork.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prices of dried fish maw range from several thousand Hong Kong dollars to more than HK$60,000 a kilogram, based on their size, thickness, origin and the scarcity of the fish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d38e23bc-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>The hair-like black moss is a must-have for Lunar New Year because its Cantonese name, fat choy, sounds similar to the expression meaning “get rich”. It can be added to various fried or soup dishes after being soaked in warm water for two hours. It is believed that the tasteless fungus acts as a cleanser in the digestive tract.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harvesting of the desert fungus, found mostly in northern China, has triggered environmental concerns. In 2000, China banned the collection and export of black moss, saying its exploitation risked causing severe damage to the desert ecosystem.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vendors say a small amount of the fungus is still available each year, and there is no ban on imports in Hong Kong. However, some of the fat choy on sale in the city is in fact imitations, made from starch, they say.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When having food, Asians look for qualities that are different from what the Westerners like,” Cheung says. “For example ... sea cucumbers and fish maw are almost tasteless, but they add special textures to Chinese cuisines.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trade on Dried Seafood Street continues to flourish, as a younger generation joins the traditional business, bringing in new ideas and skills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d43a75b8-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>Michael Mak, who studied art and design in Scotland, gave up his job in advertising in 2001 to join the family business started by his grandfather six decades ago.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mak, 57, now helps his 82-year-old father run Hoi Cheong Ho. Thanks to the younger manager, the old store now has a Facebook page and a website, where customers can place online orders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One loyal customer, 65-year-old Pauline Lau, just paid nearly HK$20,000 for some fish maw, dried mushrooms and abalone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d4e4a326-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>When Lau was a little girl, her food retailer parents would take her to the shop whenever they needed to stock up on dried seafood. And 60 years later, she still visits Hoi Cheong Ho&nbsp;regularly to get ingredients for soups.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chinese people just love these things,” Lau says. “My children are all very good at making seafood soup.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The love of flavours of the sea is being passed down to younger generations, but the industry still needs to adapt to changing tastes and cooking habits, according to Mak. He says young Hongkongers often find it too time-consuming to process dried ingredients, and some shops now offer more packaged and ready-to-cook products for millennial chefs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, sales of shark fin are in sharp decline because of rising conservation concerns. Vendors say supplies have dropped since a number of sea and air carriers banned shark fin cargos, although traders can still find ways to get them in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/19/d6177ffc-24ba-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_972x_190050.JPG>Not all of the businesses are guaranteed to stay in the family. At the 98-year-old Tung Hing Tai Kee store, Leung says none of his children are interested in taking over, but he will not feel sorry if the shop has to close one day.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am going to do this until the day I die,” he says. “The seafood industry will not disappear. People always need to eat. This is our tradition.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Treasures of the deep</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9nfXmEl3FpaKCfo7Rut86nnqxllKe2prCMrJyanp%2BksW6%2F06ucnqxdmbKuxdKtoJ%2BhlZl6tLnEpaOsZaedrrV50p6jpas%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
