The cast of &#34;Teen Mom OG&#34; just got a little smaller, according to Ryan Edwards' wife and parents.
During an interview with &#34;Without a Crystal Ball,&#34; Ryan's wife Mackenzie Edwards claimed she and Ryan's parents, Jen and Larry, were dismissed from the show.
We just got a call yesterday from [producers Morgan J. Freeman and Larry Musnik] at MTV,&#34; she alleged. &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We got fired or put on the side," she continued. "They said that when [Ryan's ex <a href=#>Maci Bookout</a>] didn't fulfill her obligations or like basically didn't have enough content, that they call us back."</p><p>As for Ryan's reactions to the news, Mackenzie made it seem like he wasn't all that bothered.</p><p>"Pretty much he was just like, 'Don't. We're gonna move on. We're gonna live our lives. We're gonna do our jobs and, you know, have a normal life. Like, don't waste your time or your breath coming back,'" she said.</p><p>Mack claimed Maci "calls the shots here," adding, "it's her show, it is what it is." She explained, "We'll be fine, I'm actually almost relieved. It's almost, like, a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I deserve to feel good about myself, I deserve to not be riddled with anxiety all the time."</p><p>Edwards' comments come after Ryan's dad, Larry, told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Sun</a>, "We, the family have been let go from the show by the network. It's unbelievable." He added that Maci was "so mad" at him for something he said about not seeing Bentley during the upcoming reunion -- and claimed, "We got in so much trouble."</p><p>TooFab reached out to MTV for comment. Maci hasn't commented on their claims on social media.</p><p>"Teen Mom OG" airs Tuesdays on MTV.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:528839ca-f797-4de3-a796-f9a48eb6a3b2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f370dd44-77fc-4c0a-9fde-fa8b84e83860 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5e/5by4/2021/01/26/5ee8c4efc3a3414c9f47008ff6141d8c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mackenzie McKee's Cousin 'Affair' Accusations Blow Up Teen Mom OG Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2xma25fqbKmuoympqZloq6ur3nEna6aqpSoeq6twqScp7KZmnqntdGem2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
