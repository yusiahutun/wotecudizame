But its team, helmed by President and CEO Rob Steele, took the 111 days of closure to breathe new life into the museum’s offerings. “We utilized this time to enhance the functionality of our 50,000-square-foot space and to create an operational platform dedicated to agility,” says Steele. The museum has adapted to allow for a continual state of change to keep fresh offerings for guests. “Visitors can still enjoy our popular exhibit opening gatherings that were a regular occurrence pre-COVID, and the broad spectrum of lectures, meditations, music, and discussions will soon be a welcome part of our reality again,” he adds. Below, we break down a few new highlights you won’t want to miss.</p><h2 class=p4><b>On Display</b></h2><p class=p2>“We have two new featured art gallery spaces, and we already have a waiting list of local, regional, and national talent to share with our guests,” shares Steele. The first gallery showcases part of the museum’s permanent collection and <span class=s2>is located upstairs in what used to be a storage space. The artwork illustrates the “majesty, force, and timelessness of the natural environment,” notes Doreen Poreba, public relations representative for the Historical Society of Martin County.

The artwork will be available for purchase, and a portion of profits will benefit the museum.</p><p class=p6><span class=s3>Guests who have never experienced the Elliott Museum should make a point to view a locals’ favorite permanent exhibition, <i>Wheels of Change</i>, which discusses the impact of commercial and personal transportation. These “everyman” vehicles were once owned and cherished by small business owners, as they wanted to create a more professional presence for themselves. Peek at more than 50 vehicles perched through the museum’s three-level car racking system, which also features a robotic tray and turntable to get up-close views of these timeless vehicles.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/12/Elliott-Museum-front-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=p4><b>Getting Crafty</b></h2><p class=p2>Now through January 31, the Elliott welcomes guests to explore their<br>creative side with a new Markerspace Lab featuring eight computer stations, four 3D printers, and two die-cut machines. Participants can create animated movies and engineering projects in addition to designs that are sent to the in-house 3D printers and laser cutters. The exhibit will also feature work on loan from the Lighthouse ArtCenter,<br>showcasing a whimsical gallery of madcap characters from six of the world’s leading animation artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/12/Elliott-Museum-3D-printed-figures-300x179.jpg><h2 class=p4><b>Holistic Healing</b></h2><p class=p2><span class=s3>One of the more self-reflective offerings is a new collaboration with Deena Rahill, founder of HI Mindfulness Forums. Rahill offers sound meditation (also known as sound bath, sound vibration, sound healing, or sound therapy) sessions to organizations that would like to help employees balance their well-being. Both virtual and in-person sessions at the museum are available.
