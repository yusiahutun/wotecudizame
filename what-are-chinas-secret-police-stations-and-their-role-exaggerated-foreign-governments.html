What are the allegations?Starting in September, human rights organisation Safeguard Defenders released reports alleging that China’s Ministry of Public Security was operating more than 100 overseas police stations in as many as 53 countries.The outposts, which have allegedly been operating as far back as 2016, were established by regional police bureaus from cities in southeastern China, such as Fuzhou, Nantong, Wenzhou and Qingtian."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead, it says they are used to provide bureaucratic services such as driving licence renewal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The relevant institutions helped overseas Chinese who could not return to China due to the pandemic,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on May 15, adding that the services provided had since moved online and that the stations had been closed down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rather than police officers or government employees, Beijing maintains that the stations were staffed by local volunteers seeking to help their communities. Investigations by authorities in the US and elsewhere have corroborated some of Beijing’s assertions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While China’s foreign ministry has said China is cracking down on transnational crimes, it said all operations were in line with international law and that Western allegations to the contrary were “smearing” and “disinformation” based on hearsay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Telecoms and online fraud have been rampant in China in recent years. In September, China passed a law giving authorities the power to pursue suspects abroad, although the law stipulates it must be done in conjunction with international law enforcement agencies.</p>Since 2014, China has also engaged in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“Operation Fox Hunt”</span></a>, the state-sanctioned pursuit of suspected financial criminals or those facing corruption charges who have fled the country.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China always upholds the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, strictly observes the international law and respects the judicial sovereignty of all countries,” Wang said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What actions have been taken by the West?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most high-profile action taken against these “police stations” was the arrest of New York residents Lu Jianwang, 61, and Chen Jinping, 59, by US authorities on April 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/22/cdf4b917-6699-401b-90f6-d539286b1c93_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They have been charged with “conspiring to act as agents of the PRC government” as well as obstruction of justice for allegedly “destroying evidence” related to correspondence with officials from the Ministry of Public Security. The station they allegedly operated was closed in autumn 2022 after it was searched by US federal agents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A growing list of other countries, from Britain to Austria, have launched their own investigations or probes into the “police stations” and their alleged criminal activities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Canada, police said they were investigating two Chinese community groups who allegedly operated “secret police stations” in Montreal, although later local media reports suggest the groups continued to operate.</p>The foreign ministries of both Ireland and the Netherlands said they had addressed the matter directly with China’s respective ambassadors. There is also mounting domestic pressure in countries such as Japan, where <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">opposition parties are calling on the Japanese government</span></a>to release more information about these stations. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/10/28/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:04</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese ‘overseas service stations’ under scrutiny after claims they are illegal police stations</p><p>Chinese ‘overseas service stations’ under scrutiny after claims they are illegal police stations</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some countries, including Italy and Serbia, previously established joint patrol partnerships between Chinese police officers and local forces. The programmes were pitched as a way to help with the growing number of Chinese tourists visiting overseas destinations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, in December Italy announced it would stop the programme – which had been suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic – in light of the report by Safeguard Defenders.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Is role of ‘police stations’ exaggerated?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeremy Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Centre, called the narrative building around these stations a “distraction” from other transnational actions taken by Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I believe extraterritorial harassment by Chinese authorities and ultranationalist citizens is a real problem [but] the role of these police stations in that is probably minimal,” Daum said.</p>Following the initial release of the Safeguard Defenders report, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Daum</span></a> highlighted that the stations operated openly in the communities they were based in and essentially acted as video conference rooms for mediation and other services.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also noted after the New York arrests that the US Department of Justice presented little connection between the alleged actions of Lu and Chen with the stations themselves.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Fox hunt’: US charges 7 in alleged plot to repatriate US resident to China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Daum said he feared the focus on “overseas police stations” was part of “a growing trend of considering everyone with perceived ties to China, be it by ethnic heritage, business, etc … as a potential agent of the [Chinese Communist Party]”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regardless of whether they were used for transnational law enforcement, the controversy was further damaging Beijing’s image in the West, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Such alleged action raises doubts about the actuality of [China’s] commitment to rule of law and respect for sovereignty despite official statements otherwise,” Chong said. “Even if the outposts are for standard administrative procedures, they still need some sort of registration.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chong and Daum both said that ongoing judicial proceedings in places such as the US should “shine more light” on the station’s operations.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘Drowning out the messaging’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Tuesday, Safeguard Defenders said it had been the target of a “prolonged” disinformation campaign involving tens of thousands of fake social media accounts since the release of the initial report in September.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On YouTube and other websites, thousands of virtually identical videos and blog posts have appeared under a similar name to the group’s original report, but they contain a 669-word defence of China’s position on the matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Twitter, references to the reports were temporarily banned after a mass of suspected bot accounts triggered the social media site’s anti-spam filter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twitter’s overhaul of its verification scheme allowed thousands of accounts to masquerade as Safeguard Defenders, the group said. While the social media site has reportedly removed as many as 1000 “impostor” accounts, a search by the South China Morning Post showed hundreds of accounts using the same name, profile picture, and bio as Safeguard Defenders remained on the site.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/11/02/WEBCLEAN-netherlandspolice.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:37</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Illegal Chinese police centres in Netherlands ordered to shut immediately</p><p>Illegal Chinese police centres in Netherlands ordered to shut immediately</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The campaign was “seemingly aimed at drowning out the messaging and online visibility of Safeguard Defenders,” the group said in a press release.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It added that its previous reports on China have triggered similar waves of online harassment, but the group stopped short of calling it a state-coordinated operation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is no way to know whether this campaign has State-backing, but the scale of operation and its uniformity indicates a single body is directing it,” Safeguard Defenders said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3N9knJtaK%2BYlsFurdGeZJygmaOutHnSnpqrnaRivbC4yJycZquklsGqu82sZJqmlGLBqbHIq2Srp5yaeqbEwKCenqqRqbKlecWoqZ6hl6N6qLvVnqmnpZWjwbQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
