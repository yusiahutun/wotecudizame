History-making Best Actress hopeful Yalitza Aparicio, the first-ever indigenous Mexican to be nominated for the film world’s highest honor, lived in grinding poverty and called a ramshackle tin hut her home, DailyMailTV can reveal.
Yalitza was so poor she had no means of transport to get to the school where she worked as a teacher.
