Maybe you write graffiti or maybe you <a href=#>doodle</a>?&nbsp; Either way we all know that we love to make our own creations and share them with our friends and strangers alike. I have come across a very nifty web site that is called SketchFu - kind of like Kung Fu but with more drawing,m, less killing.</p><p>You do not have to sign up or register to enjoy SketchFu to create drawings online, contrary to popular belief. But if you want to save your doodles or submit them for others to see, you will need a free login and password. I did not do that for this article.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Let's see how it works.</p><p>Navigate on over to SketchFu [No Longer Available] and you will be greeted by this screen:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketch1.png><p></p><p>They have up a basic doodle showing what you can do with the application with a little imagination. You can see drawings other users have created on the right hand side. You can click on them and see what the users created. You can also "cheer" it or comment on it if you have an account.</p><p>To create a drawing online yourself (why else would you have gone to the site?) all you have to do is hit the New button at the bottom of the home page. There are 5 colored arrows pointing to it and a circle saying try it. Hopefully you will find the button!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketch2.png><p>The drawing interface you see above is all there is to it! You can choose the color of your brush and your brush size"¦ That's it! The other buttons at the top let you undo or play back your drawing, stroke by stroke, anywhere from twice to 256 times. Check that out after you are done drawing - a very cool feature and it can show others how to create your image from scratch!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketchColor.png><p>Above you can see the color picker which is activated simply by hitting the black box next to the word color at the top of the interface. You can either type in a color's hex code or choose from the chooser.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Next up we see the different brush sizes that we can use. You select the one you want by clicking on it and then drawing. There are 6 different sizes ranging from teeny tiny to whoa that's fricking big!</p><p>You can see I drew a line with each one below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketchBrush.png><p>After finding the site I decided to draw a little. Show everyone how awesome I am with a paint brush"¦.but oh wait! I can't paint! So maybe you will get a laugh out of my SketchFu sketch as you can see below it is on par with my 2 year old's skills :)</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketch3.png><p>Now that you all had a good laugh at my expense let's take a look at what talented people can do with this application:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/SketchChee.png><p>So that is the top bunch of sketches that have been cheered on by the community. It is really amazing what some of these artists can do with a simple application like this! Here is <span class=removed_link>my favourite -</span> you can click on it and watch how the artist drew it line by line. This is sooo cool!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sketchCat.png><p>I am very impressed by this site and it's contributors - do you know of another similar site to create drawings online? We would love for you to tell us about it so we could check it out!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmL%2BmrdOeZJ2qkay2r7PSZqanpJmjsm670WapmqyVYry1tMSrqmavmam1br%2FKnqucoJaqfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
