Newman <a href=# rel="follow noopener">struggled</a>&nbsp;with drug abuse during the marriage and apparently abandoned the family a few years in.&nbsp;</p><p>Gladys raised the kids on her own but did not divorce him until later. They separated after a decade in 1973.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Then, she married music producer and label manager&nbsp;Barry Hankerson in 1974. They share one son,&nbsp;Shanga Ali Hankerson. However, things didn't work out with Barry either, and they eventually divorced in 1979.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her divorce from Barry was even uglier because of the custody battle over their son.&nbsp;</p><p>You might like:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Bobby Brown's Net Worth, Married Life and the Tragic Loss of His Kids</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Nevertheless, she did not lose hope and gave marriage another chance with&nbsp;motivational speaker Les Brown. They tied the knot in 1995 but ended shortly with a divorce in 1997.</p><p>After three unsuccessful marriages, you'd think Gladys would be hesitant about opening up her heart again. But, she stood fearless with her force of love and found the one meant to be.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She had a&nbsp;heart full of love and wasn't ready to give up just yet. She told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SF Gate</a> in an interview,</p><p>Love is what makes the world go around. I know it's a big cliche to use, but it is the absolute truth. There is nothing else like it.</p><p>"I know that is what everybody is striving to feel, in relationships, in brother- and sisterhood and in all of the things that we aspire to have in our lives," she added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Moreover, she has recovered and moved on from her past and has found the silver lining in it.&nbsp;She said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I know those challenges that come up from time to time in life are our little learning tools, our little steppingstones. If we didn't have those things in our life, how would we learn anything?</p><p>Adding on, she stated, "We need those obstacles in our life because I know one thing -- I'm a much better person for them. And I ain't even mad at nobody."</p><p>No problem seems too big for the bold and courageous singer. As a result, she now happily resides with the man she loves and sits atop a glorious career and net worth.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Is Gladys Knight's Net Worth?</h2><p>Gladys began her musical career in the 60s.
