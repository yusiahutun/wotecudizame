If a file seems missing or corrupted, you receive an error popup on the screen. In such a case, try running the SFC scan first.</p><p>SFC (System File Checker) is a handy built-in tool to find and <a href=#>replace missing or corrupted system files on Windows</a>. Here's how to fix the missing DLL files on Windows using the SFC tool:</p><li><a href=#>Open Command Prompt as an administrator</a>.</li><li>Type the command:<strong> sfc /scannow</strong> there and press <strong>Enter </strong>to execute it. The SFC tool will now open and automatically fix most issues it finds.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sfc-command-preview.jpg></li><p>Note that the SFC utility is only helpful in case of errors with default Windows apps such as Microsoft Store, Photos, and Camera app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><h3 id=reinstall-the-software-causing-the-problem>Reinstall the Software Causing the Problem</h3><p>When installing third-party software for the first time, it asks for several options in its setup stage. Suppose your computer suddenly shuts down or reboots at that moment. In this case, the software may install incorrectly due to corrupted installation files.</p><p>Here's the good news: reinstalling the software usually fixes this issue. But, you must ensure a clean uninstallation first, as sometimes residual files create troubles during a new setup.</p><p>So, how to fix the '<strong>DLL Not Designed to Run on Windows</strong>' error in case of faulty software installation?</p><p>To begin with, check <a href=#>how to uninstall software on Windows</a> first. After uninstalling, download the latest version from the developer's official website.</p><h3 id=run-a-complete-malware-scan>Run a Complete Malware Scan</h3><p>Often, the malware targets the DLL files that the software uses to work correctly. It modifies those files to bypass or execute the desired functions, increasing the chances of DLL-related errors. So, running a full system scan using a reliable antivirus program is advisable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're a beginner, <a href=#>use the Microsoft Safety Scanner</a> for malware scans.
