"Cheekbone filler is a truly amazing way to refresh your appearance in a natural-looking way," says Dr. Rabach.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-cheek-fillers-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do Cheek Fillers Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cheekbone filler is a cosmetic procedure that involves injecting a gel-like formulation under the skin to increase vibrancy or restore volume from signs of aging. The process is completely tailored to your specific needs, goals, and anatomy in order to enhance your natural bone structure. Cheek filler is most commonly used to add more lift to the outermost part of the cheekbone and bring more light up around the eyes, Dr. Liotta tells us. It's also used to boost volume at the apples of your cheeks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eliminate areas of shadow</a>, she adds. "The good and the bad of fillers is that they're not permanent," says Dr. Liotta. In fact, cheek filler is an excellent shorter-term solution to correct asymmetry and achieve facial balance and harmony.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-cheek-fillers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Benefits of Cheek Fillers?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to adding a more youthful texture and sculpted appearance to the face, cheek fillers have several benefits. Since the solution added to your face plumps and lifts your cheek area, this also includes near your undereyes, reducing the appearance of undereye circles and smoothing smile lines. Creating a contour with cheek fillers also reduces or even eliminates the need to makeup (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>contouring sticks</a> and highlighter) that would achieve the same look, making your getting ready time a lot quicker.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-type-of-filler-is-best-for-cheeks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Type of Filler is Best for Cheeks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are two main types of filler that are best for the cheek area," says Dr. Rabach. "One is hyaluronic-based filler <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Juvdérm Voluma</a> and the other is called Radiesse, which mimics bone." Dr. Rabach frequently combines the two types of filler for enhanced, albeit natural-looking, results. Meanwhile, Dr. Liotta exclusively favors HA-based fillers due to the fact that they can be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dissolved</a> in the very unlikely event that they need to be removed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-will-cheek-filler-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Will Cheek Filler Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To sustain your cheeks' newfound fullness, Dr. Liotta says you'll have to plan on repeat injections about every one to two years. The lifespan of cheek fillers will depend on the type and amount of filler used. Also, your metabolism can impact longevity, as each person's body chemistry absorbs filler a little differently, notes Dr. Rabach.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-does-it-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Does it Cost?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The price of filler tends to vary by geographic region and doctor experience, in addition to what kind of filler and how much of it is used. Generally, for an appointment with a reputable, experienced board-certified dermatologist or surgeon, you can expect to pay in the neighborhood of $1,000 to $1,500 per syringe. While injectables can be costly, it goes without saying: don't bargain shop when it comes to your face.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-i-know-about-recovery-and-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Should I Know About Recovery and Aftercare?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The beauty of this treatment is precisely how incredible the result is with essentially no downtime," says Dr. Rabach. Still, she recommends skipping the gym on the day of your procedure and popping a Tylenol if the soreness becomes uncomfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bruising and swelling, although uncommon, are best soothed by applying an ice pack. While the affected area may be a little tender to the touch for the next day or so, it typically feels like nothing more than what Dr. Rabach calls "a faint bruise."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-risks-or-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Risks or Side Effects?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Often, the biggest risk with cheek filler, or filler period, is not knowing when to cool it. "Filler is biostimulatory," says Dr. Alexiades, founder of Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center of New York and Associate Clinical Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. What that means is that skin is stimulated to expand to accommodate the injection. So if skin is overstimulated (aka overfilled), you can expect adverse reactions: "[cheeks] end up looking round, almost like softballs, overinflated, and sometimes have a dimply appearance," Dr. Alexiades cautions. To avoid such a scenario, check in with yourself to make sure your goals are realistic and listen to your doctor if they discourage the procedure. And although it's rare, if you experience any sensory loss or severe pain post-procedure, reach out to your doctor immediately.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-if-i-dont-like-my-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What if I Don't Like my Results?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most important steps to ensure you're happy with your cheek filler is to leave no stone unturned when researching a prospective doctor. This includes taking a long, hard look at the before-and-afters on their site to ensure their work vibes with your vision. "You need to choose someone who has an aesthetic that you trust," emphasizes Dr. Liotta. "Beauty is, of course, subjective, and overdoing it can make a body positive decision to get filler into a regretful waste of money."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're feeling a little unsure about your results, try to hold judgment for about two weeks post-procedure to let any lingering swelling subside, but if you're still anything less than totally happy, you can have your provider <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dissolve hyaluronic acid-based fillers</a> with an injection of hyaluronidase, which Dr. Liotta says should work within 48 hours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLCpscSkZJ%2BhnKGys78%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
