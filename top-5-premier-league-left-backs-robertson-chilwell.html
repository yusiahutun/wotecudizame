After a long lockdown, players are back in training and ready to complete the 2019-20 season.
There's plenty up for grabs too, including European places and a real relegation battle - even if Liverpool have all-but won the Premier League title.
As we prepare to welcome the return of the top-flight, we're running down our top five players in every position."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

ANDREW ROBERTSON</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-AVA-LIV-REPORT_23638596_RC17AC268600_2019-11-02T165407Zjpg-JS536343988.jpg><p>BEST in the world? Quite possibly. Best in the Premier League? Absolutely no question.</p><p>The Scottish star, 26, has been a key member of an impenetrable back-four at Liverpool.</p><p>Strong in the tackle and quick to get back when needed, Robertson's positional play is superb.</p><p>And his work going forward, teaming up with right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, has been extraordinary - with the pair continuously trying to out-do each other in the assists stake.</p><p>This season, <a href=#>Robertson</a> has seven assists and nine clean sheets through 28 Premier League games.</p><p>He also scored a crucial late goal against Aston Villa to help Liverpool battle back from 1-0 down to snatch a 2-1 win.</p><h2>2. BEN CHILWELL</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-BRH-LEI-REPORT_1877997628_RC25HD9QXV7D_2019-11-23T170918Zjpg-JS542263826.jpg><p>NOW England's No1 left-back, Leicester star Chilwell is comfortably the second-best in the Premier League, behind only Robertson.</p><p>The Three Lions star, 23, is <a href=#>on the radar of Chelsea</a> ahead of a potential summer move.</p><p>And it's easy to see why, with Marcos Alonso and Emerson struggling and Chilwell strong both defensively and going forward.</p><p>The Foxes star has three assists, two goals and eight clean sheets from his 23 league appearances this term.</p><h2>3. LUCAS DIGNE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-LNC-EVE-REPORT_1786831197_RC1132A9BFE0_2019-08-28T192639Zjpg-JS516923132.jpg><p>AFTER Robertson and Chilwell, there are a host of talented stars who could take the No3 spot for the No3 shirt.</p><p>But Everton ace Digne, 26, is our man thanks to his impressive all around game.</p><p>The former Barcelona ace has a dynamite left foot - and is quality from dead-ball situations.</p><p>While the Frenchman has failed to score this season, he has added five assists in the Premier League to go with four clean sheets.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FOOTBALL</h2></p><h2>4. LUKE SHAW</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-DRB-MUN-REPORT_432931077_RC2WDF9T8IM9_2020-03-05T202212Zjpg-JS568623960.jpg><p>THE Manchester United star seems to cop plenty of flak - whether for his perceived weight issues or lack of form.</p><p>But in terms of pure quality, <a href=#>Shaw</a> easily deserves a spot in the top five.</p><p>The England star still has his best years ahead of him and has shown signs of a resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p><p>Shaw moved to Old Trafford from Southampton for a hefty £30m when he was just 18 and the unenviable task of living up to that price tag has been hampered by some truly nasty injuries.</p><p>If he can stay fit, Shaw can not only become United's undisputed No1 but even challenge Chilwell for the starting spot internationally, too.</p><h2>5. ENDA STEVENS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SPO_AFP_1P783Zjpg-JS565138394.jpg><p>IT would have been so easy to say Danny Rose, Marcos Alonso or Ryan Bertrand - because they're established Premier League stars.</p><p>But if we're talking best left-backs in the league based on current form? Look no further than Sheffield United star Stevens.</p><p>The Irish ace, 29, has started at left-wing-back in rock-solid back-five under Chris Wilder at Bramall Lane this season.</p><p>As well as keeping <strong>NINE</strong> clean sheets, Stevens has scored two and assisted on a further two in a superb season.</p><p>Also, special mention to Bukayo Saka, who has shone at left-back this season filling in during Arsenal's defensive injury crisis.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kieran Tierney could be set for Arsenal exit after just one injury-ravaged season as Leicester target transfer</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2Z%2BeIWPaXBvZ6SkvW6BjKmpnqWZmr9uuMSanq6dXaGyp8CMm5ico6Niv7CuxKurrKeeYrCptcuwnKWkXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
