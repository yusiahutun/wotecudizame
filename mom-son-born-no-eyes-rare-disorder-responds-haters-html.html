Christian Buchanan, 11, from Tennessee, was born with amniotic band syndrome, which is when strands of tissue wrap around a developing fetus, preventing the baby from growing normally.
For the young boy, it has caused several facial clefts affecting his eyes, lips and nose, as well as developmental delays and blindness."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

layer of the placenta, called the amnion, is damaged during pregnancy.&nbsp;</li><li class=class>If this happens, thin strands of tissue (amniotic bands) form inside the amnion.&nbsp;</li><li class=class>These fiber-like bands tangle around the developing fetus, restricting blood flow, thus affecting the growth of certain body parts.&nbsp;</li><li class=class>It is typically very difficult to detect amniotic band syndrome before birth, but the condition can sometimes be detected via ultrasound.&nbsp;</li><li class=class>The disorder is extremely rare and affects anywhere from 1 in 1,200
