Gag City derives its name from the word “gagged” which in slang means: to be stunning. When Nicki released the album art for Pink Friday 2, many fans, affectionately called Barbz, imagined what it was like to live in the backdrop city. Thus, Gag City was born. AI generated photos of what Gag City could look like started to trend on Twitter. Barbz even generated famous celebrities and characters who could live in Gag City like <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://x.com/hugefarm/status/1732494528840425510?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dakota Johnson</a>, Tom Holland (as Spider-Man), and Peppa Pig.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Nicki has even joined in the Gag City trend. She posted on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1732447398901993980>X,</a> “As we begin to prepare for landing, please make sure your tray tables are put back up & your seat belts are tightly fastened. The captain has activated the “no bathroom” sign. If you look out the window, you’ll begin to see the beauty…clear waters, pink dolphins…<a href=# rel=nofollow>#GagCity</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#PF2</a>.” She also further teased out her latest single in a post on<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1732604290081169663> X</a> with the caption, “Approaching <a href=# rel=nofollow>#GagCity</a>“</p><p>Pink Friday 2 is the sequel to Nicki’s debut studio album from 2010, and will serve as her first LP since 2018’s&nbsp;Queen.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfnK6oecKiq7JlkZ56qLHNnqmarJ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
