His controversial story includes both allegations of injustice and tragedy. Instead of being treated like a victim, the police ended up labelling him as one of the prime suspects in the tragic incident.</p><h2>What happened to Ryan Waller?</h2><p class=align-left>Ryan Waller and Heather Quan were attacked and shot in their home on 25th December 2006. The <a href=#>cute couple</a> were preparing for pre-Christmas dinner with Ryan’s dad.

He tried to slam the door but wasn't fast enough.</p><p class=align-left>The attackers shot him in the head through his left eye; believing he was dead, they went to the next room and shot his girlfriend, Heather.

He called <a href=#>the police</a>, who immediately responded and went to Ryan and Heather's house. The police found Heather Quan dead, but Ryan Waller was still alive.</p><p class=align-left>Instead of calling for immediate medical help, the police took Ryan into custody. He sat in the police car for about four hours and was taken to the interrogation room the next day at 5 am. Detective Paul Dalton questioned Ryan Waller while still critically injured and in pain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8dd6f3e364d419d9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Siaya Woman Shot by Police Officer Husband Dies While Undergoing Treatment: "I Wanted to Change Him"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the interrogation, Ryan said little and insisted he wanted to sleep. He was able to give an account of the attackers. But apparently, the detective wanted him to confess that he shot and killed Heather – but he didn't.</p><p class=align-left>After several hours of interrogation, the police called the medics and informed his dad that he was in critical condition.</p><p class=align-left>The doctors said the lack of immediate medical attention made Ryan develop a life-threatening infection. Ryan Waller took 35 days to recover; in the process, he lost his left eye and a brain section. Ryan continued experiencing seizures for several years.</p><h2>Is Ryan Waller still alive?</h2><p class=align-left>How is Ryan Waller now? Sadly Ryan died of a seizure on 20th January 2016. A complication from the head injury he got in 2006.</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Ryan Waller's face? The doctors removed his left eye and a section of his brain. This rendered him partially blind and also affected his other natural capabilities.

Richie was charged with misconduct involving weapons, aggravated assault and murder. His trial took several years, but in 2008 he was finally sentenced to natural life in <a href=#>prison</a> without parole.</p><p class=align-left>In November 2011, Larry Carver was re-indicted for attempted first-degree murder, first-degree murder, aggravated assault and Burglary. In 2012, the case ended with Larry Carver being found guilty on more than one count. He got sentenced for possibly spending his entire life in prison without parole.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Ryan Waller injuries wouldn't have become so life-threatening if the police could have treated his case with urgency. They chose to treat him as a suspect and had him in custody for hours, yet he was severely injured and in pain.
