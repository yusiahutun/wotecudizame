  Extremes of heat take a toll on your hardware, and it's important to take steps to keep your devices cool.
The Effects of Extreme Heat on Electronic Devices  When electronic components like capacitors, diodes, motors, and batteries are used in phones, laptops, projectors, and other devices, they tend to generate heat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is due to things like the transfer of current, friction from moving parts, chemical reactions, and conversions from different energy forms.</p><p>As heat generation is inevitable, most electronic devices rely on heat dissipation, fans, <a href=#>heat sinks</a>, and other cooling mechanisms to function safely and effectively. However, when the temperature is too hot, these mechanisms might not be enough to keep your gadgets from overheating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/raspberry-pi-case-fan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei found</a> that using your computer or phone in a hot environment will make heat dissipation less efficient. This means it’ll be hard for your device to spread out the generated heat; instead, the heat can build up and damage your device over time.</p><p>The probability that your device or its components will degrade, slow, overheat, burn, or fail increases with temperature.</p><p>Of course, you might be unable to avoid extreme heat entirely, especially if you’re living in warmer climes or it’s summer where you are. Nevertheless, there are things you can do to protect your devices from the effects of extreme heat.</p><h2 id=keep-your-devices-away-from-sources-of-heat>1. Keep Your Devices Away From Sources of Heat</h2><p>Although this seems pretty obvious, the foremost measure is keeping your gadgets away from sources of extreme heat. Most electronics perform best around room temperature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Avoid using your devices outside under direct sunlight or beside stoves and fireplaces. Relocate your workspace if it’s close to a window, and the sun is directly upon your gadgets. If you need to use your phone, Wi-Fi router, computer, or device outside, try to do so under a shade.</p><p>Try not to use your devices during peak hours when the weather is hottest. Also, don’t leave your devices in your car, even if turned off, as the temperature can rise to dangerous levels.</p><h2 id=proper-ventilation>2. Proper Ventilation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1200x600-6.jpg><p>Most devices can withstand high temperatures if they’re well-ventilated. Place stationary devices like routers, PCs, and game consoles in well-ventilated areas—not behind furniture or tight spaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Avoid placing your devices on pillows, carpets, and other soft surfaces which can obstruct airflow. Instead, use a stand or <a href=#>cooling pad for your laptop</a> or tablet. If you’re using a protective case, ensure it allows your device to breathe.</p><p>Regularly check for and remove dust buildup in your devices. Excess dust or lint caught in your computer’s vents could impede the fans, increasing the risk of overheating.</p><h2 id=use-high-quality-protective-cases>3. Use High-Quality Protective Cases</h2><p>Using a protective case made of leather, plastic, or foam on your device would be like wearing extra layers of clothing. Do you wear extra layers of thick clothing when the weather is scorching hot?</p><p>If you must use a protective case, ensure it’s made of heat-resistant materials like rubber, metal, or silicone. Choose cases that have adequate vents so heat can dissipate.</p><h2 id=turn-off-your-devices-when-not-in-use>4. Turn Off Your Devices When Not in Use</h2><p>If you're not using your device, turn them off. This is because background processes can cause your devices to heat up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if you can’t turn them off, you can put them in sleep or airplane mode—anything to reduce heat generation and power consumption. It’s best to save power because <a href=#>charging in a hot environment can boost overheating and damage</a>. Some devices even have built-in features that restrict charging currents and speed when the temperature’s high.</p><p>Alternatively, disable background processes or unnecessary apps and features.</p><h2 id=monitor-the-temperature-of-your-devices>5. Monitor the Temperature of Your Devices</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ios-emergency-call-feature.jpg><p>If you’re in a hot environment, make it a habit to check your devices for signs of overheating, like excessive heat or weird burning smells. Alternatively, you can <a href=#>use a temperature monitoring application</a> or your device’s in-built monitoring software to check the safety of your electronic components.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your device is getting hot, stop using it or turn it off and let it cool. You can also use cooling apps and accessories to help your device cool.</p><h2 id=keep-your-devices-cool>Keep Your Devices Cool</h2><p>Extreme heat can harm your devices and affect their functionality and durability. Following these tips, you can keep your devices cool and protect them from overheating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxuvNGoq56bpGKxpsLInJysZZSqv6q6xmacsayimrqmeceemK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
