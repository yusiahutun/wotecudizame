After that, I went to school in Virginia and bounced around on the East Coast for a little bit. Three years ago, I came to New York to launch Rowing Blazers.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did growing up in Seattle have an effect on your style?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">​I think so! It’s not a particularly stylish city, but I learned that my outfit always has to have a certain level of practicality. I have to dress for the weather. I can’t wear something just because I love it and disregard the fact that it’s really hot or cold in New York. In that sense, there is always this sensibility to it. I love just being casual. It kind of blew my mind when I went to school in Virginia, and boys were just wearing chinos that their moms didn’t make them put on! It’s been fun for me to push my comfort zone, which is from the very casual side, and learn to be more dressy. I have that kind of preppy and classic look.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you think you took more away from Virginia than you did from Seattle in terms of style?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think in Virginia, because it is very homogenous, I sort of pushed against it. However, I also learned to appreciate it. So, maybe now, yes, but at the time, no! So much Lilly Pulitzer.</p><img alt="Font, Text, Circle, Label, " title="Font, Text, Circle, Label, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pq1-1569611829.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you think rowing had any effect on your style? ​D​id it change how you viewed getting dressed?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In school and college, there was a very specific athlete look. I think oftentimes professors treated athletes differently. I always wanted to sort of go against that and not lean into wearing all the free gear and fitting into that stereotype. So, in that sense, yes. Obviously now, learning about the history of the blazer and how it comes from the sport of rowing has renewed for me. It’s been through the lens of menswear specifically, which is interesting. I wouldn’t say that my time as a rower got me here beyond that’s how I met Jack, and through Jack, I learned all of this. It was two degrees of separation.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did you know anything about the history of the rowing blazer before?​</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No! I knew it was a thing—that if you went to Henley, your team would get blazers. And it always seemed really cool. It wasn’t really a tradition at UVA going for the women, the men’s team did. It was very peripheral at first.</p><img alt="Font, Textile, Pattern, " title="Font, Textile, Pattern, " width=1080 height=1534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo5-1569611466.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you think you still approach dressing with that sporty feeling?​</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, I think so. I do love wearing leggings and T-shirts to go around on casual days. I think the way I dress now is very much a celebration of being able to shop for my body type, which wasn’t ever something I could do in high school. Online shopping was still very new, and there weren’t a lot of tall pants that were cool. I don’t think I’ve leaned into the athlete thing so much now that I’m not doing it. I enjoy being able to dress like a normal person now if that makes sense.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Shopping for pants specifically when you’re really tall is hard! My sister is tall and pants are mid-calf on her.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was hard as a high schooler! When I was in high school, it wasn’t cool to have cutoffs or culottes. You wanted to have pants that were dragging on the ground, and I could not find that! I wish I could travel back in time and give myself a little more confidence to buy vintage men’s Levi’s and rock it, but it’s high school. I got there eventually!</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Tell me the story behind something you’re wearing right now.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The sweater Jack actually got for me. He knows I’m obsessed with Princess Diana, as everyone is right now. He tries to borrow it from time to time. It’s cute that our interests cross and that he got it for me. The skirt I got at a secondhand shop in Charlottesville years ago. It’s technically a size too small, but I love it and it feels so one of a kind.</p><img alt="Plaid, Tartan, Pattern, Hand, Finger, Design, Ring, Turquoise, Textile, Engagement ring, " title="Plaid, Tartan, Pattern, Hand, Finger, Design, Ring, Turquoise, Textile, Engagement ring, " width=1080 height=1534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo4-1569611490.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LULU GRAHAM</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Any stories behind some of the jewelry you're wearing?​</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t make many impulse purchases, hardly ever. I often see things on Instagram that I covet, file it away, and think about it later. But this ring was at a vintage store in England when we were at Henley Royal Regatta. It just felt like if I didn’t buy it right then and there, I wouldn’t get that chance again. I don’t know how old it is, but I want to do some research on it. It was a great price and in this little curio cabinet.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It’s such a fun thing to know you bought it because you were in that moment.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Exactly, it reminds me of that trip! It feels like it has history behind it.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How would you describe your style?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I​ think it’s exploring with what works for my body type, as someone who is very tall, and sort of making sure trends work for me. It’s also being really honest about what doesn’t work. I feel very inspired by Scandinavian street style right now. There is such a big emphasis on repurposing old trends and being kind of funky and colorful, but not so “fashion.” Just enjoying wearing clothes.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What have you found works well for you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">​High-waisted jeans and pants are something I realized I should have been wearing a long time ago. That’s been a cool thing about being in the menswear world: I’ve taken a lot of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://rowingblazers.com/collections/pants data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rowing Blazers pants" data-vars-ga-product-id=f6e0c27a-d0b5-4a6d-a7b2-02c5fcb30ffb data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://rowingblazers.com/collections/pants data-product-url=https://rowingblazers.com/collections/pants data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Frowingblazers.com%2Fcollections%2Fpants" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fd8a7893-b009-45d8-a656-d0f4518ff581 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Rowing Blazers pants</a>, a​nd taken in the waist a little. I love that more relaxed fit and leaning into the more masculine side of things. I was so sensitive about that when I was younger because I was so tall, I didn’t want to wear oversized things.

So I love The Breakfast Club. This is kind of cheesy, Erin Brockovich had a big influence on me. In terms of don’t judge people by their cover and wear what makes you feel good!

I think especially with a lot of the trends going on right now, she was the OG. I love Françoise Hardy.

I love Downton Abbey for that same reason. That kind of elegance, even in the maids’ costumes, is so well done. It’s hard to pick an actual period. When Stranger Things first came out, a friend who is also my age, said it made us both nostalgic for a time we didn’t live through. The styling is just so good!</p><img alt="Turquoise, Green, Room, Table, Poster, Textile, Furniture, Pattern, Linens, Rectangle, " title="Turquoise, Green, Room, Table, Poster, Textile, Furniture,
