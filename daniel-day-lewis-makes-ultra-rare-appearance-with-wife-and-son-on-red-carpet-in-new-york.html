Daniel, acclaimed for his role in My Left Foot, was every bit the dashing figure in a double denim ensemble.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b5625a61e124-gettyimages-1715784121.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eK_5P7V_kkf data-wc=26>His outfit spoke of his distinctive style, complemented by a black shirt and an unusual turquoise string tie. His look was both classic and uniquely Daniel.</p><p id=eyfyEhLkqgw data-wc=18>Beside him, Rebecca, renowned in her own right and daughter of the legendary playwright Arthur Miller, exuded elegance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/139a34c127ae-gettyimages-1715767371.jpg><p id=ecJXslM6C9F data-wc=21>She donned a sleek, sleeveless black top coupled with shimmering black pants and enhanced her ensemble with a chic designer handbag.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_Zr5MFaO_5 data-wc=20>The couple's 25-year-old son, Ronan, also joined them, opting for a laid-back look with a casual white tee and jeans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/31c6807c1ff4-gettyimages-1715765770.jpg><p id=eFyfjKevjLs data-wc=22>The occasion marked the premiere of Rebecca's romantic comedy, which boasts a star-studded cast including Anne Hathaway, Peter Dinklage, and Marisa Tomei.&nbsp;</p><p id=enJObPdgV0c data-wc=32>While the spotlight was primarily on the film, Daniel's presence on the red carpet was undeniably significant.

Reflecting on his decision, he had confided in W magazine: "All my life, I’ve mouthed off about how I should stop acting... it was something I had to do." With his retirement, the film industry lost the unparalleled talent of the only actor to clinch three Best Actor Oscars.</p><p id=eqihBVWgXa- data-wc=56>He first achieved this honor in 1989 for My Left Foot. Then, in 2007, he won for There Will Be Blood, and in 2012, he secured his third for Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln. Currently, Daniel divides his time between New York City and Annamoe, Ireland, cherishing moments with his wife, Ronan, and their younger son, Cashel, 21.&nbsp;</p><p id=evMVBJTSm52 data-wc=15>From a previous relationship with French actress Isabelle Adjani, Daniel has a 28-year-old son, Gabriel.</p><p id=e4rF3T4-I5I data-wc=38>On a related note, the premiere of She Came To Me also had other Hollywood stars in attendance.
