"They are most common on the face and lower legs."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Bashey, this condition is caused by several factors like sun damage, genetics, aging (thinning skin), and trauma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over time, the sun's rays thin out the skin, which causes a decrease in collagen, elastin, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As this occurs, blood vessels become slightly more obvious and emerge close to the junction between the epidermis and the dermis," explained Dr. Bashey.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Usually, these slightly spidery enlarged veins are small, dysfunctional capillaries. Anyone who exposes themselves to the sun without <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>proper SPF protection</a> is putting themselves at risk of developing broken capillaries. While they can occur in any skin type, they are most common in fair-skinned individuals with thin or sensitive skin and those with skin conditions such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rosacea</a>&nbsp;and scleroderma, per Dr. Hibler.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-the-skin-condition></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent the Skin Condition</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proper sun protection is the best way to prevent broken capillaries. On top of wearing sunscreen and following a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>personalized skin-care routine</a>, Dr. Bashey suggested making a few lifestyle changes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wear a hat outdoors</a>&nbsp;and avoid tanning or laying out in the sun from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. These precautions are especially important for those with rosacea because they're typically more sensitive to heat and sunlight.</p><p>Proper sun protection is the best way to prevent broken capillaries.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"By avoiding heat, limiting sun exposure, and avoiding other triggers that cause flushing in susceptible individuals — like hot or spicy foods and alcohol consumption — you may be able to prevent ... broken capillaries or slow their appearance," explained Dr. Hibler. "However, once they're present, only an in-office laser or light treatment will get rid of them."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-broken-capillaries></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of Broken Capillaries</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although we love a good DIY treatment, according to Dr. Hibler, an in-office treatment is the only way to permanently get rid of broken capillaries.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are no safe, effective at-home remedies for broken capillaries," Dr. Hibler added.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Try laser therapy.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best, long-term solution to reduce redness and eliminate broken capillaries is to treat with a laser or light device," said Dr. Hibler. "These treatments use specific wavelengths of light which are absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood vessels to seal them off."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One type to try? Pulse lasers, which "target anything on the face that is red and spares surrounding tissue that does not have ... hemoglobin," explained Dr. Bashey.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two settings to this laser: One that bruises and one that doesn't.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The non-bruising setting is less effective and will require more treatments, but essentially does not have much downtime at all,"&nbsp;Dr. Bashey noted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another option to ask your derm about is the 1064 Nd:YAG laser.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This laser is often used for capillary formation around the nose," said Dr. Bashey. "It is often the [go-to] laser when the pulse dye laser fails. It works through a similar mechanism but acts deeper in the skin due to its long wave."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider a light treatment.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Photo: Getty Images / MajaMitrovic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Hibler suggested an alternative to laser treatments is a light treatment with an intense pulse light device. This minimizes the redness caused by capillaries forming, as well as pigmentation from sun damage through the use of intense, broad-spectrum pulses of light.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Apply a topical treatment.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are some topical treatments, such as oxymetazoline, which act as a vasoconstrictor to temporarily reduce redness on the face due to broken capillaries," Dr. Hibler told us. "Studies have shown that consistent usage of this topical medication can reduce background redness."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Conceal with makeup.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For those not ready to undergo an in-office procedure, green-tinted cosmetic products can be used to help camouflage redness and broken blood vessels on the face," said Dr. Hibler.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We suggest something like the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Make Up For Ever Step 1 Primer Color Corrector</a>&nbsp;($23).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-see-a-professional></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to See a Professional</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Broken capillaries typically do not result in any symptoms or harm to a patient and do not require treatment," Dr. Hibler said. "However, if you're bothered cosmetically by broken capillaries, they can be safely and effectively treated with a laser with little to no downtime."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Bashey also warned that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>deeper skin tones may experience hyperpigmentation</a>&nbsp;from the heat-based devices used for broken capillary treatment. He also noted that aftercare should include applying sunscreen immediately and avoiding the sun for a few hours. Then, you can go back to your usual skin-care routine and lifestyle.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1om6KlmaO2tLSMm6moo5WjeqetwqKYpWWTlr2quMuaqaKdow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
