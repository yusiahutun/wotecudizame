CNN's Chris Wallace is facing backlash for questioning Adam Driver's looks.
In a new interview with the 40-year-old actor on Wallace's Max series, Who's Talking to Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist asked Driver about how he doesn't &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Those are the actors that made me want to be an actor, so that's a nice comparison," Driver said before rejecting the comparison. "The New Yorker has also called me a horse-face."</p><p>He continued, "I remember reading one reviewer [who said], 'His agent probably doesn't know whether to put him in a movie or the Kentucky Derby.' So if you believe the good thing, you have to believe the bad thing. So I try to not absorb anything."</p><p>Further discussing his looks, Driver noted that he's worked pretty consistently, adding that his non-traditional movie star appearance has seemingly had no negative impact on his career.</p><p>It's then Wallace hones in on Driver's atypical looks, asking the actor whether or not they've been a hindrance or a help to him onscreen.</p><p>"I've worked consistently, which is nice, with people I always dreamed that I wanted to work with," Driver said. "I look how I look. I can't change that. So, I guess it helped me."</p><p>The only time his looks have been a hindrance for him, Driver said in quite a sarcastic tone, has been when he passes a mirror, breaking it along the way, or when he tries to get his six-foot-two frame into small cars and doorways.</p><p>"A hindrance in only breaking mirrors wherever I go, and having a misshapen outsized body that I can't fit through doorways or most clothes or fit into most cars, so apart from that, it's good," the House of Gucci star quipped.</p><p>Continuing to press the issue, Wallace asked if Driver wondered if he'd have an easier time in Hollywood if he had the classic movie star good looks of someone like Robert Redford.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:55d2a176-2ea6-4890-bd7e-3dbfaae4dbf6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:050fee97-6649-4e80-9812-217e6f54c34a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1c/5by4/2022/02/15/1c901d13356248e4b58b2c9203fd0ef2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">House of Gucci Makeup Artist Göran Lundström Says Jared Leto Wanted To Be Unrecognizable (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"If I looked like Robert Redford it would be easier," Driver pondered before answering. "Yeah, but it would just be different. I would be giving something off..."</p><p>"Maybe I'm trying to be diplomatic. And I guess if I was alone in a room, I'm like, 'Who Doesn't want to look like Robert Redford?'"</p><p>Driver added, "I just kind of accepted this is how I look."</p><p>The Star Wars: The Force Awakens actor's fans quickly came to his defense after the interview went live last week, with a clip from Driver's back-and-forth with Wallace catching fire and eventually going viral over the weekend.</p><p>Some on social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>called Wallace a "scumbag,"</strong></a> while others labeled the journalist, who left Fox News after 18 years in Dec. 2021, "dumb" for his line of questioning.</p><p>Another fan, meanwhile, wrote, "I feel like I hear far more about people thinking he's hot and attractive than the opposite."</p><p>TooFab has reached out to Wallace's reps for comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-6bbdaa18-74a3-4539-aae5-d26f619dc295 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6bbdaa18-74a3-4539-aae5-d26f619dc295 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20231204_f32969e8ee2f41d0928d363d340c6820 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:050fee97-6649-4e80-9812-217e6f54c34a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f3/4by3/2023/12/04/f32969e8ee2f41d0928d363d340c6820_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaWxfmLWztdJmrpqknJawpnnSpZimpZWZeqe70Waorp2jqbawusinnmaZlJa6brDRoq2eqqNiubC7yqxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
