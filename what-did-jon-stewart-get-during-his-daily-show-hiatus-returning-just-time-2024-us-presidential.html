He was awkward in front of the cameras while speaking to his first guest, Michael J. Fox, as he tried to adjust to the previous format of the show. But then he found his voice, focused on what he was good at and took control. From 1999 to 2015, Stewart was one of America’s foremost social voices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart was the recipient of at least 60 awards and nominations, illustrating the widespread acknowledgement of his talents. In an interview with Vanity Fair, he said that his goal when he started was simply to have fun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Success for me would’ve been feeling like I figured it out. That I got to express the things I wanted to,” he said. “It was never ‘I want this to be a cultural touchstone, but only for a very small portion of America.’ And I was hoping to stay on TV longer than nine months this time.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Stewart’s voice returns</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2021, several years after his departure from The Daily Show, he debuted The Problem with Jon Stewart, a talk series on Apple TV+. The move was seen as a big coup for Apple and was part of a multi-year first look deal that Stewart signed. Season one aired episodes every two weeks, while season two aired weekly. The 60-minute show dealt with one topic per episode.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The controversial end</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/03ec9124-a513-4d8f-a908-66043e446f31_1e73fd75.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was widely reported that The Problem with Jon Stewart would not get a third season. Although initial reports claimed the split between Apple and Stewart was amicable, The New York Times stated that Stewart and his bosses clashed over “creative differences”. Particular issues that caused tension included AI and China, per the publication.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Sean Hannity’s Fox & Friends TV host girlfriend, Ainsley Earhardt?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to The Guardian, US lawmakers asked Apple to explain why Stewart’s show ended, with concerns being raised that it was because of China. In a letter to Apple boss Tim Cook, a House committee wrote, “While companies have the right to determine what content is appropriate for their streaming service, the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing these determinations.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The short-lived animation venture</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/acdf82ac-7b6a-4a3c-ba06-2e23df7dea74_aa83154a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, it was announced that Stewart would collaborate with HBO to create short-form animation ventures designed for various platforms, but the project was eventually cancelled. HBO said at the time that it would continue to look at other projects with the comedian.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Trevor Noah connection</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/83af77b1-1594-4742-9e78-623f819834f0_027d2500.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">South African</span></a> comedian Trevor Noah took over as host of The Daily Show after Stewart left. Stewart and Noah have spoken highly of each other over the years, with Stewart acknowledging how Noah did better than him in some ways. Referring to Noah being more engaged in conversations on social media platforms, Stewart said: “For Trevor, it’s a part of him. It flows from him naturally … It makes it better.
