After her death, Gigi was honored by the WNBA, alongside other basketball players Alyssa Altobelli and Peyton Chester.</p><p>“Kobe was not only a legendary basketball star, but a devoted youth coach and had a tremendous impact on countless young players. I met Kobe last fall and after he left our office I remember thinking that his passion for the WNBA and girls basketball was unparalleled from anyone else I had ever met,” WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a speech in April. “Alongside Kobe, eight others were lost that sad day in January, including three rising basketball stars. Alyssa Altobelli, Gianna Bryant and Peyton Chester. These athletes represented the future of the WNBA.”</p><p>At the celebration, Vanessa talked about how her daughter wanted to be a legendary athlete like her father. “She wanted to be one of the greatest athletes of all time just like her daddy,” Vanessa said. “I’m so proud of you, Gigi. God I miss you baby. You deserved to live a long, healthy and happy life,” She later added on her Instagram. “I wish I could hold you and tell you how proud I am of you. You’re the best, baby girl. Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/entertainment-banner.jpg alt="StyleCaster Entertainment News Letter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kGtscW9oZMOiusSsqpplkqfGorrTZp6in5litLOtw66YraGfo3qsu8GeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
