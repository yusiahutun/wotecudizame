There is no better place in Nashville to demonstrate the resilience and unity of this community than at the Opry House, so let’s show the world that we are all #CovenantStrong.”</p><p>"A Covenant Knight at the Opry&nbsp;House" is being put together by Houston Phillips and Chas Schultz, Covenant School parents and industry music veterans.</p><p>"This event stands as a powerful testament to the unwavering strength of Nashville’s country music community, friends, neighbors, and especially parents," Phillips notes. "I was truly moved by the inherent goodness of those who offered support, no questions asked, as we worked to create an event that would lift up our community and contribute to Covenant School’s ongoing recovery efforts."</p><p>Proceeds from ticket sales will go to&nbsp;the Covenant School Community Fund, an organization which aims to provide mental health support as a new school year is approaching.
