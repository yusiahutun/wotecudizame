And in an unexpected move, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30577363/cameron-diaz-daughter-raddix-middle-name-drew-barrymore/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Barrymore class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Barrymore</a> invited her ex-husband, Tom Green, to be a guest on her show this week.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The emotional interview saw the former husband and wife speak for the first time in over 15 years. Barrymore and Green met when the actress hired the comedian to star alongside her in Charlie's Angels, which was released in 2000. The pair soon started dating, and it wasn't long before they moved in together. They tied the knot in July 2001, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/09/25/drew-barrymore-tom-green-reunite-divorce-marriage/3531723001/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USA Today" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">USA Today</a>, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/tom-green-files-for-a-divorce-from-drew/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Green filed for divorce" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Green filed for divorce</a> in December that same year, citing "irreconcilable differences."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the fact that their whirlwind romance came to a seemingly abrupt end, Barrymore and Green's reunion on the actress' talk show was surprisingly endearing. Introducing Green, Barrymore said, "I have always been attracted to visionaries, comedians, and people who make me laugh. I was so attracted to our next guest I even married him!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Barrymore emotionally told Green, "We've haven't seen or spoken to each other in far too long." Green had nothing but support for his ex-wife and said, "Thanks for having me here, Drew. And I really, really couldn't be more excited about your new show. It's nice to see you everyday on here, just bringing this burst of happiness, and energy, and optimism into the world right now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Green's appearance even made Barrymore tearfully reminisce. "I've had two nights of great sleep in my life before my daughters were born," she revealed. "And I don't know why but sleep is like, it's just been like a weird thing for me. And I remember this night just being so content, and I was at your parents' lake house, and I remember hearing all their voices upstairs, and I was just by myself, and I was going to sleep and I was like, 'Yeah, this is what, y'know, safety and contentedness feels before you're going to sleep. And I will never forget that night. And I love your parents, and I really love you, and I celebrate you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Green also seemed to get emotional reflecting on the length of time they'd spent not talking. "We really did not talk for about 15 years, I guess, and this is really the first time we've looked at each other face-to-face in 15 years," he told the host.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Y'know, when you say 20 years, sometimes it’s the blink of an eye and sometimes you’re like, oh my God. We’ve lived so much in these last 20 years," Barrymore said. "You’ve had a whole life and I’ve had a whole life, and it’s just really nice to come together and check in and talk about it. It just, it thrills me to no end. I think the world of you and I celebrate you and I always have and I always will."</p><img alt="72nd annual academy awards arrival" title="72nd Annual Academy Awards - Arrival" width=995 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-green-and-drew-barrymore-during-72nd-annual-academy-news-photo-1601131810.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KMazur</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Drew Barrymore and Tom Green at the Oscars in 2000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prior to her marriage to Green, Barrymore was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-and-will-kopelman-split-headed-for-divorce-w167751/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="briefly married to bar owner Jeremy Thomas" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">briefly married to bar owner Jeremy Thomas</a> in 1994, although the couple split weeks later. The actress wed her third husband, Will Kopelman, in June 2002, but the couple's breakup was announced in April 2016. Kopelman and Barrymore share two daughters, Olive and Frankie, who they continue to coparent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen this week, Barrymore revealed that she'd joined celebrity dating app Raya, only to be stood up. Barrymore said that she saw plenty of celebs on the app, and told Cohen, "It was like looking through an Us Weekly."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, she didn't have the best experience trying out online dating. "I got stood up, and I didn’t match with anyone," she revealed. "And my friends gave me this sort of bloated sense of false confidence. They were like, ‘You should try it. You will do great.’ It was a car wreck."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
