I say this because, honestly, I have no idea what I am going to do with three batches of cranberry sauce I’ve cooked over the last week, but if at least one them makes it home with you, I suppose this effort won’t be a waste after all. Is this as noble and un-self-serving of me as it sounds? Of course not — I love cranberry sauce — I just have a little bit more than a two-person household should ever need.</p><p><span id=more-83></span></p><p><a href=# title="classic cranberry sauce with orange peel"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/99/293821030_586d060a75_z.jpg alt="classic cranberry sauce with orange peel" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I’m not sure if it was because I was a vegetarian and without the turkey, the cranberry sauce made no sense, because I thought it always came from a can in a fun-to-play-with but terrifying-to-eat cylinder, or because I just didn’t like it, but I never ate cranberry sauce growing up. It wasn’t until my first year in New York when I lived in a worn and infested fourth-floor walkup on Avenue B with my friend Dan that I had the real deal, and completely fell in love. Dan’s from Massachusetts and from what I understand, they take cranberry sauce pretty seriously up there, or at least he did, simmering, zesting oranges and carefully sifting through the rinsed bag for deflated or still stem-attached berries. This classic cranberry sauce recipe (which I am sure he’ll tell me I’m getting wrong) will always be my favorite, stirred into plain or vanilla yogurt or simply taken spoon-to-mouth. I hedge on the sugar a little, preferring it on the tart side, but I never skimp on the orange peel, as there’s a reason it is so often paired with cranberries: they bring out the best in each other. A few julienned or thick-zested strips in the sauce is one of my favorite parts; simmered in the stunning rouge syrup, they candy like an orangette, and are a fantastic surprise when you run across them in your hungry tasting. Lest you need any more evidence of its greatness, look how little we have left from a week ago.</p><p><a href=# title="mixed-berry quick cranberry sauce"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/120/293821040_8b7f342b25_z.jpg alt="mixed-berry quick cranberry sauce" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The second cranberry sauce is Alex’s mother’s recipe and his family’s absolute favorite, despite my efforts to convert them to the back-of-the-bag classic. It’s terrifyingly simple (I’ll let you find out for yourself at the end, but promise that you’ll laugh), but I’m warning you, addictive. With mixed berries and walnuts, it seems more dessert than dinner, in my opinion, and the spoonful we had over vanilla gelato two nights ago was almost unbearably delicious. Alex’s mother told him she had a new recipe to try this year – something with jalapenos and ingredients that scare me – and he said, “sure, sounds good, but only if you make the other one, too.”</p><p><a href=# title="well ain't you the prettiest thing"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/105/293821025_f7b4fc1e51_z.jpg alt="well ain't you the prettiest thing" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The final recipe is a new one and for the record, my husband was absolutely horrified at the thought of it, but I persevered. I mean, port? Love it. Balsamic? Ditto. Dried figs? Yum. Black pepper? Intriguing. Rosemary? Could be. Brown sugar? Hells yeah. All together with cranberries? Er, ah, …it took me an hour to even try it and even now, I’m just not sure I fell in love. (Right now, Alex is biting his tongue, but I’m sure it won’t be long until he says “told you so!”). It’s … (hang on, let me try it again) … wine-y. I think it would go well with turkey, or even some roasted potatoes. I’m just not sure it’s good for spooning, and if there’s anything the above two recipes should hint to you, it’s that I like the stand-alone cranberry sauce. At your Thanksgiving table, however, I’m sure it will get no complaints, a sauce for the sauced grownups, if you will.</p><p><a href=# title="roses, even prettier on their way out"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/119/293821048_3d1d4935de_z.jpg alt="roses, even prettier on their way out" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Homemade Whole Cranberry Sauce</b><br>Adapted from the back of the Ocean Spray cranberry bag, and my friend Dan</p><p>Makes 2 1/4 cups</p><p>3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>1 cup water<br>1 (12-ounce) package fresh or frozen cranberries, rinsed, drained and sorted through, removing any stems or deflated ones<br>Several julienned strips of orange peel, or thick pieces of zest<br>A few squeezes of orange juice</p><p>Combine water and sugar in a medium saucepan.
