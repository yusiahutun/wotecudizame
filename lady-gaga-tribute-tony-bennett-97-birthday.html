August 3rd is Tony Bennett Day,‚Äù she wrote, referring to a resolution the U.S. Senate passed on July 27 officially designating Bennett‚Äôs birthday a holiday. ‚ÄúA day for smiling. But I‚Äôll be celebrating you a lot more than once a year. I‚Äôll celebrate you every time I‚Äôm on stage singing jazz music, every time I‚Äôm with your family, every time I walk down the streets of New York I‚Äôll look around and remember all you did for this city and the whole world. üòò‚Äù</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gaga also shared photos of herself posing in front of a sidewalk food cart in New York City, where she wore a black jacquard ball gown from Christian Siriano‚Äôs Spring 2018 collection. She accessorized with black cat-eye sunglasses from Illesteva, a black purse from Mark Cross, and a black hat from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://gigiburris.com/products/laura-black?variant=29557262024774" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gigi Burris Millinery" data-vars-ga-product-id=881165eb-8195-4caf-8e10-5f02fec60856 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://gigiburris.com/products/laura-black?variant=29557262024774" data-product-url="https://gigiburris.com/products/laura-black?variant=29557262024774" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgigiburris.com%2Fproducts%2Flaura-black%3Fvariant%3D29557262024774" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$385.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7d84036f-2ada-4818-a97a-4c8fbab067e3 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Gigi Burris Millinery</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gaga‚Äôs close friendship with Bennett spanned more than a decade, with the powerhouse musical duo recording two Grammy-winning albums together, 2014‚Äôs Cheek to Cheek and 2021‚Äôs Love for Sale. The two also embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from late 2014 to mid-2015, and performed together in the 2021 television special One Last Time: An Evening With Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù singer also honored Bennett with an Instagram post earlier this week. Captioning a photo of the two embracing, she wrote, ‚ÄúTony & I had this magical power. We transported ourselves to another era, modernized the music together, & gave it all new life as a singing duo. But it wasnt an act. Our relationship was very real. Sure he taught me about music, about showbiz life, but he also showed me how to keep my spirits high and my head screwed on straight.‚Äù</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, ‚ÄúThough there were 5 decades between us, he was my friend. My real true friend. Our age difference didn‚Äôt matter-- in fact, it gave us each something neither of us had with most people. We were from two different stages in life entirely--inspired. Losing Tony to Alzheimer‚Äôs has been painful but it was also really beautiful. An era of memory loss is such a sacred time in a persons life. There‚Äôs such a feeling of vulnerability and a desire to preserve dignity.‚Äù</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
