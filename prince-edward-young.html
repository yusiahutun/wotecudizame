At birth, Edward was third in line for the British throne and is now 14th in the line of succession.</p><p>Born on March 10, 1964, Prince Edward was given <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the title of Earl of Wessex</a> by his mother upon his marriage in 1999. Before that, he was known, simply, as Prince Edward. His childhood was largely spent in the public eye due to his royal status, but there is relatively little known about his early years compared to his older siblings, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, and Prince Andrew.</p><p>He attended Gibbs School, Heatherdown School, and then Gordonstoun School in Scotland, following the tradition of his family. His time at Gordonstoun, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like his father and elder brothers</a>, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, was said to be formative, emphasizing outdoor activities and character-building exercises, but he’s reported to be more reserved compared to his siblings.</p><p>After completing his education, Prince Edward pursued a career in the Royal Marines but eventually withdrew from the training program. He then decided to pursue a career in entertainment and production, establishing his own television production company, Ardent Productions, in 1993.</p><p>Amid his brother King Charles’ cancer battle, Edward <a href=#>has had to step in</a> and take on more responsibility. Recently, he was dubbed Colonel of the Scots Guard—the ceremonial head of the Scots Guards regiment in the British Army.</p><p>“It was a huge privilege, but also quite a lot of weight of expectation as well,’ Edward said, as he marked his 60th Birthday. “I mean, there’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>an awful lot of legacy</a> that came with that title and everything that my father had done, especially when you’re not inheriting it—this is a choice.” On getting used to his new title, Edward said: ‘It’s just the weirdest and strangest feeling.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=prince-edward-young>Prince Edward young</h2><p>In photos of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Edward young</a>, you can see a sense of quiet ambition.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>Royal Train Ride, 1964</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-toddler.jpg><p>Prince Edward (left) and Prince Andrew leave Liverpool Street Station in London for Sandringham House in Norfolk, UK, 30th December 1964.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Queen Elizabeth II and her two sons, 1964</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-prince-andrew.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth II with two of her sons, Prince Andrew (left) and the baby Prince Edward, London, 13th June 1964.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-2><h2>Prince Edward & Prince Andrew, 1966</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-2.jpg><p>Prince Edward and Prince Andrew playing with fallen leaves in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Go-Karting Royals, 1969</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-king-charles.jpg><p>Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince Edward ride together in a go-kart while Princess Anne drives behind them.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Royals at the Olympics, 1976</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-queen-elizabeth.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth ll and her sons, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales attend an event at the Olympic Games on July 19, 1976, in Montreal, Canada.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Prince Charles Sketching at Windsor, 1989</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-prince-charles.jpg><p>Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales sketching on the bank of the River Thames, at Windsor Castle, with Prince Edward, and accompanied by his dogs, on March 23, 1989 in Windsor, United Kingdom.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Trooping The Colour, 1964</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-baby.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh with the Queen Mother and their sons Prince Andrew and baby Prince Edward, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in London during the Trooping the Colour ceremony, UK, 13th June 1964.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>In New Zealand, 1983</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-edward-prince-charles-princess-diana.jpg><p>Prince Charles with Diana Princess of Wales and Prince Edward, at a photocall at Wanganui Collegiate in New Zealand, where Prince Edward had been a junior tutor for two terms.
