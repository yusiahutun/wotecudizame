KRIS-6 Newsreports the Nigerian-American is living out his vision to become a businessman. Now, he is fortunate to combine his pursuits in entrepreneurship with his interest in sports, particularly soccer. It’s why he founded the Corpus Christi Football Club (CCFC) in 2016.
“I realized we didn’t have anything like that in Corpus Christi,” Dr. Okonkwo told KRIS-6 News."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, he is fortunate to combine his pursuits in entrepreneurship with his interest in sports, particularly soccer. It’s why he founded the Corpus Christi Football Club (CCFC) in 2016.</p><p>“I realized we didn’t have anything like that in Corpus Christi,” Dr. Okonkwo told KRIS-6 News. “So the idea and the concept came, can we build something here?”</p><p>In 2017, the football club was official and able to bring a soccer franchise to the city, which became known as the CCFC Sharks. Now, Dr. Okonkwo is looking to establish a facility that not only offers a field they can have as familiar soil but also open doors for other sports.</p><p>“What we’re building is what will be a world class facility,” Okonkwo explained, per the outlet. “Our athletes will be able to play soccer, baseball, softball fields. We will not need to travel every time.”</p><p>The development, which is being funded by an investment group led by Okonkwo and Next Sports Company, is anticipated to cost $28.3 million, <a href=#>per</a> the club website. Called “a once in a generation project,” the sports complex is projected to break ground in 2024, with a stadium that will seat 5,000. It also includes nine fields that will be used to host tournaments and play with other teams. Okonkwo admits the journey has not been easy, but feels the rewards will make his efforts worthwhile.</p><p>“It feels good to know that when you put in a lot of hard work, you can see the benefits of the hard work,” he said, according to KRIS-6 News.</p><p>The outlet notes it is reportedly the first Black-owned sports complex in Corpus Christi. What’s more, this isn’t the only “first” for Okonkwo, who also reportedly leads the city’s first and only Black-owned pediatric clinic and urgent care.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to be a pediatrician since I was 12 years old,” Okonkwo explained to KRIS-6 News. “The first clinic I opened was actually in Odessa, TX, about 5-6 years ago. It’s grown to 4 different clinics, and the Corpus Christi branch is actually the fifth branch.”</p><p>Wearing many hats, the doctor-turned-owner also left some words of encouragement for others looking to make their mark in society.</p><p>“The key to success is a good education and hard work. There’s no way around it. And I also make it clear to them that they should not allow other people’s view of them to become their reality,” Okonkwo shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnJ6wqbHMmp5nm5%2BifLWxwqFmnapdoLavs9KlnLJln6C8r7fWqGStp12kvaa6jJpka3BdaLpuudSlq6Jlo6W8s8DSZpqopaChsrl5yKdknKeipcK0ecKhqaKrpJ56tcSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
