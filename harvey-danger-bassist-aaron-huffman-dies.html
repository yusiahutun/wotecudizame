The homemade subcultural life here in the early ’90s drew Aaron out of his intense shyness, and gave him a model for emerging as the smart, funny, gentle, discerning artist, husband, and father he became,” Nelson wrote.</p><p>Huffman, along with Sean Nelson and Jeff Lin formed Harvey Danger in 1993. The band had their first major hit in 1998 with the single "Flagpole Sitta", which is also used as the theme tune to the British sitcom Peep Show.</p><p>The band went on hiatus in 2001 after releasing their second album and after reforming in 2005 to release their third album "Little by Little" they parted ways for good in 2009.</p><p>According to The Stranger, Aaron is survived by his wife, son, and mother, who request privacy in their bereavement. – Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGigkafDpsWMnZinn5WneqOt0qygrKxdlq6zu81mn66elqKur3nDopysZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
