She married the British computer programmer in the early 2010s and was his wife until his death in 2021.</p><p>For most, she is McAfee’s trusted partner. Dyson’s late husband McAfee created anti-virus software that would detect a computer virus and automatically remove it. While McAfee’s innovation brought millions of dollars into his bank account and helped solve many problems, he also became a “top target” for hackers. In addition, he was occasionally at odds with international legal committees.</p><p>And another person who has, or continues to receive attention in all this is Janice Dyson, to whom the British-American technology entrepreneur entrusted his life. Find out how she came to love McAfee, what her life was like as his wife, where she comes from, and what she does – all in the columns that follow.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Janice Dyson Is Originally From Guatemala&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Dyson was born in 1983 in Guatemala. As of 2021, she is approximately 30 years old.</p><p>However, beyond the above details, there are few facts about McAfee’s African-American wife, especially when it comes to her life before meeting the antivirus developer.</p><p>However, it is believed that she came from a rather poor family and suffered from domestic violence at some point in her adult life, in addition to poverty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Janice Dyson Was A Prostitute When She First Met Her Husband John McAfee&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Janice first met McAfee</a> in 2012, she was working as a prostitute in South Beach, Florida. A software developer had hired her for sex. He had then fled Belize after becoming the prime suspect in the murder of his neighbor, according to Newsweek.</p><p>Although Janice and McAfee were more than 38 years apart in age, they married in 2013. They remained husband and wife for a total of eight years, until the death of the first of them in 2021.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bert Kreischer’s Daughter Georgia Kreischer: Bio, Age, Career</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Janice Had Some Ulterior Motives For Marrying John&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Interestingly, sometime after they started dating, it emerged that Janice Dyson had started a relationship with McAfee in order <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to spy on him for the cartel bosses</a> she worked for. In fact, she had received orders from them to use drugs and poisons.</p><p>She would therefore pass on information about his movements to gangsters who wanted to kidnap him. She worked for her former associate, Delmarie Kamani Crutchfield, known as “Suave”. The original plan was to kidnap and rob her.</p><p>According to some insiders, Dyson’s pimp blackmailed her into feeding drugs to McAfee and even forced her to leave the door unlocked at the couple’s home in Lexington, Ky.</p><p>But Dyson had real feelings for John, and while she planned traps for her husband, she also indirectly cajoled him every step of the way so he could survive. McPhee’s paranoia and his extensive security detail also helped a lot.</p><p>Later, he found out that his wife was spying on him. However, he did nothing because he understood the state she was in.</p><p>During their relationship, John also protected her from people who forced her into prostitution.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Dyson Remained Loyal To Her Partner Till His Death</strong></h2><p>After their marriage, the couple lived in a mansion in Tennessee for some time, with bodyguards and staff left and right for Janice’s safety and security. They also traveled around the Caribbean and some parts of Europe. They had no children.</p><p>Then, in 2019, the authorities <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">arrested Jaison and her husband while they were on a yacht in the Dominican Republic.</a> They were traveling with their crew to the United States. Reportedly, when police confronted the couple, they were in possession of firearms.</p><p>Janice and McPhee were released sometime after their arrest.</p><p>Then, on 5 October 2020, McAfee was confronted by the Spanish authorities responsible for tax evasion. Spain had obtained a United States Department of Justice manhunt warrant. The indictment of June of that year alleged that he had earned millions of dollars between 2014 and 2018 and had failed to file income tax returns.</p><p>Dyson supported her husband when the police detained him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Janice Dyson’s Husband Apparently Committed Suicide In A Spanish Prison&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>On 23 June 2021, police found Janice’s husband lying dead in his cell. He was serving his sentence at the Brians 2 penitentiary near Barcelona. His death occurred on the same day that a Spanish court ordered his extradition to the United States.</p><p>An official autopsy confirmed that it was suicide. Shortly afterward, the authorities reported that he had committed suicide by hanging himself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She Believes Her Husband John McAfee Didn’t Kill Himself&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Following the news of John McAfee’s death, much speculation and conspiracy theories emerged. Everyone wondered and speculated whether he had really taken his own life.</p><p>On Instagram, Janice shared a post in which she claimed to have spoken to him earlier and said that her husband, who is a tech nerd, showed no signs of suicide.</p><p>Dyson claimed that someone or some group had hatched a plan to kill her husband because he knew a lot about a corrupt group of people and thus wanted to “silence” him for good.</p><p>Since his death, Janice has continuously sought justice for her deceased partner – demanding a thorough investigation and promoting hashtags on social networks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>People Believe Janice Dyson Gained A Lot Financially After Her Husband’s Death&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It is unclear what Janice inherited and what her net estate is after McAfee’s death, given the millions of dollars he earned. However, sources speculate that she may have profited significantly from the Gloucestershire resident’s many properties and wealth, albeit less than before.</p><p>These include his five-acre oceanfront mansion in Hawaii, a private Cessna plane with 10 people, a 157-acre ranch in New Mexico with a 35-seat cinema, artworks, and dozens of luxury cars. All this with a yacht or two.</p><p>In addition, for many years while living with McAfee, Janice lived a luxurious lifestyle thanks to the programmer’s multimillion-dollar fortune.</p><p>Although, as already mentioned, he had lost most of it in financial losses while he was still alive. Thus, he made headlines in August 2009 when he lost a total of USD 96 million out of his net worth of USD 100 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She Would Have Been The First Lady Of The United States</strong></h2><p>Dyson’s late husband once announced his intention to run for the US presidency in the 2016 presidential elections through a then-new political party called the Cyber Party. Later, the owner of McAfee Associates changed his party to the Libertarian Party. McAfee came second in the primaries and third in the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.</p><p>Later in 2020, he announced on Twitter that he would run as a Libertarian candidate in this year’s presidential election.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is Corrie Bird Adopted?

She had reportedly left her children in the United States while she was on the run with her programmer husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Janice-Dyson-kids.jpg><p>As for McAfee, he once boasted that he had up to 47 children from previous marriages. He further claimed to have 61 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. Although he said he had never met any of his grandchildren. However, he claimed to have sent the financial support.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>John, Himself Was Married Twice Prior To Having Relationship With Janice&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Janice Dyson was McAfee’s third wife. Prior to Dyson, McAfee was the husband of a woman he had met during his doctoral studies at Northeast Louisiana State College. At that time, she was an undergraduate student. The university expelled Janice’s future partner for having an affair with the younger woman. However, they married in 1968.</p><p>Janis’ second marriage was to Judy McAfee, a yoga enthusiast and former American Airlines flight attendant. She helped him set up the company in 1987. They were married until 2002.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where Is Janice Dyson Now?</strong></h2><p>In December 2021, McAfee’s last wife published quite lengthy posts via Instagram, mostly about how she was coping with the death of her late husband and the aftermath. She described being in constant fear that someone wants her life and finding it difficult to leave Spain.</p><p>She also complained that the investigation into John’s death was too slow. In addition, she said that things had been quite stressful in recent months.</p><p>Her children are apparently in the USA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Janice Dyson</strong></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=0.85382059800664><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Janice McAfee</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Celebrity Wife</td></tr><tr><th>Country:</th><td>United States</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>5 feet 7 inches (1.70m)</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>widow</td></tr><tr><th>Husband</th><td>John McAfee</td></tr><tr><th>Wife</th><td>64</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Net Worth</th><td>$1 Million – $4 Million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Kids</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Twitter</th><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Janice McAfee Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><th>Instagram</th><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Janice McAfee Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKmx0Z5koqtdn66vtcKeZJ2xo6S7brrOsGShnaJiuaqyxGaZnp6fp7JurcWtnKtlmqS1r3nMnJifnZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
