They all promise some kind of slimmer you sans surgery. The treatments and technologies are continuously innovating to be more customizable and comfortable, to promise more convenient results. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonlaser.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=EON class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">EON</a>, a robotic touchless laser device, is a newcomer on the scene that's raising the bar. "I've been using this device for the better part of the year and have seen really phenomenal results," says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.beautybybuford.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Gregory A. Buford" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Gregory A. Buford</a>, MD, FACS, a plastic surgeon in Denver, Colorado. The device, which heats and destroys fat cells, promises efficient, personalized treatments to reduce stubborn fat, all without touching a patient's skin. Here's how.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Is EON and How Does It Work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">EON is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared device that can help permanently destroy fat cells around the abdomen and flanks (or love handles). It uses first-of-its-kind, touchless robotic technology to reduce fat with consistent energy via a 1064nm laser.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike other popular body contouring devices, EON uses heat—not cold—to reduce fat. The laser heats the adipose (deep fatty tissue beneath the skin) up to 123.8°F. This can jumpstart the body's cellular turnover process, while also allowing dead fat cells to be removed by the lymphatic system over the course of three months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To ensure the comfort of the patient, the device employs an air-powered jet cooling system to bring down the skin's temperature as the fat cells are being heated.</p><img alt="eon laser" title="Eon Laser" width=2000 height=1124 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dominiondevice360-off-06-1653407735.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Eon</span></p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who Is a Good Candidate for EON?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Treatments with EON are best for people who want to eliminate stubborn areas of fat on the abdomen and flanks that diet and exercise haven't affected. EON is not for people who want to lose a lot of weight all over. "I think of it as a spot treatment," says Dr. Buford. A BMI of under 30 is generally recommended for optimal results.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regardless of your starting weight, though, it's important to have realistic expectations. "I always emphasize to my patients that any non-invasive treatment, EON included, is only part of the solution. It's not going to replace healthy habits," Dr. Buford says. "The people I've seen who have gone into it with reasonable expectations have been overjoyed by the results."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Happens During an EON Appointment?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Patients don't need to do anything special to prepare for their EON appointment. Typically, they will lie down in a treatment room and a clinician positions the device at an appropriate height above the targeted area. Patients are given safety goggles and told not to talk (it can move the abdominal wall up and down too much) or use their phones. Forty two smart sensors scan and map the person's body topography so the device knows exactly where it should target the laser. The sensors can also help detect skin temperature and the proximity of the device to the skin during the treatment to ensure patient safety.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each area takes about 20 minutes to treat, which means it's about 60 minutes for the full abdomen. The area is generally done in three sections dependent on the patient's body topography. And it’s about 40 minutes for the flanks (20 minutes on each side).</p><img alt="eon laser" title="Eon Laser" width=2000 height=1245 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eon3-1-1653407033.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Eon</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've had the treatment done a couple times myself," says Dr. Buford, "and I’ll tell you, the downside is that it's completely boring. There was no discomfort. I fell asleep during it." Some people report a prickly, tingly sensation, but Dr. Buford says the only thing he really felt was the blast of cold air from the cooling jets.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is Any Post-Treatment Care Required?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once the EON treatment is over, that's it. There is no additional uncomfortable massage, time-consuming gels, or strange numbing sensations that have been reported with other body contouring devices. "Plus, there's zero downtime time with EON," adds Dr. Buford. "I say you can go from treatment to the beach. You can work out, you can do anything you want to do."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Kind of Results Can People Expect?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although results vary among individuals, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33903903/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies have shown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">studies have shown</a> patients experienced 21.6% average fat reduction (25.3% in the lower abdomen) 12 weeks after a single 60-minute treatment. Dr. Buford has had patients lose as much as four inches after a single treatment, but he says the best results are usually found after a series of two to three treatments spaced about six weeks apart. In general, treatments can range from $3,000 to $4,000, but prices vary by location so <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonlaser.com/find-a-provider/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="consult your EON provider" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">consult your EON provider</a> for an accurate quote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppsYGWGcoSScmaep55itrR5wGalnq9dl7ylxYycpqesn6q%2FqrrGZqurnZGpuqa602aroZmkYrumwsSrZK2npZi1pr%2BMsqauql2ouKq6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
