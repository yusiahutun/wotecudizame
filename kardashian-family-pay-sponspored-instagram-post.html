In addition to their TV contracts, beauty lines, and endorsement deals, promoting products on Instagram is another lucrative source for the famous family's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22117965/kardashian-family-net-worth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="massive incomes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">massive incomes</a>. And such sponsored posts do not come cheap.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My daughters are constantly getting offers to post something for a company, or a brand, on social media," momager Kris Jenner said in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/preview-kris-jenner-as-the-force-behind-a-family-empire-worth-billions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CBS This Morning" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CBS This Morning</a>. "They have a fee for a post, or a fee for a story, a fee for Facebook … they have a fee schedule."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So how much are we talking, exactly? "I mean, it's definitely six figures," Jenner said. (Meanwhile, here I am posting mediocre OOTDs for free ninety nine.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although Kris didn't share exact numbers, she did explain variations in pricing for her daughters' Instagram ads. It mainly depends on the subject of the post and which family member is going to post it. (She didn't specify if certain siblings get paid more than others per post.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They also charge more if the ad is for "a pharmaceutical product, if it's something that you're going to drink, or ingest, or put on your body," Jenner explained. We've previously seen Kylie promote hair vitamins, Kim promote diet shakes, and Khloé promote skincare on Instagram, which means they all probably made a substantial amount of money from those posts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are downsides to these money-making endorsements, however. Critics, including activist and actress <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a26097999/jameela-jamil-interview-aerie-campaign/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jameela Jamil" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jameela Jamil</a>, have called out the sisters for promoting products like "fit teas" because they can contribute to harmful body image stereotypes. Fans have also called out Kendall Jenner for her dramatic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25781798/kendall-jenner-proactiv-annoucement-twitter-reactions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Proactiv ads" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Proactiv ads</a> and for her involvement in promoting the doomed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a27028770/kendall-jenner-fyre-festival-responds/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fyre Festival" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fyre Festival</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Kim Kardashian defended their social media promotions as business decisions. "You’re going to get backlash for almost everything so as long as you like it or believe in it or it’s worth it financially, whatever your decision may be, as long as you’re O.K. with that," she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/style/kardashians-interview.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a> in March.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kim also doesn't say yes to every sponsored opportunity she receives. When one fast fashion brand offered to pay her $1 million for a post, she turned it down because her husband Kanye West said the line ripped off his designs, NYT reports. As a thank you, he gave her a $1 million check on Mother's Day.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Khloe Kardashian's Beauty Evolution" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-02-06-at-4-53-27-pm-1549490033.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
