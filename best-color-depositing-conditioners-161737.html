Before you pick up the phone to schedule (yet another) appointment with your colorist, consider trying one of the best color-depositing conditioners to keep your tresses looking glossy and rich with your chosen shade. These specially-formulated treatments are an easy and cost-effective way to keep your color fresh between salon visits.</p><p>Not sure which color-depositing conditioner is right for you, or never even heard of color-depositing conditioner before? Don’t worry! We’re here to break it down for you. Keep reading to get the full scoop, or just scroll down to shop our picks for the best color-depositing conditioners for every shade of hair!</p>Read More<h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is a color-depositing conditioner?</h2><p>We love coloring our hair, but let’s face it: Colored hair requires some maintenance. Whether it’s due to <a href=# rel=noopener>heat styling</a>, sun damage, or simply the passage of time, all hair colors fade. This where the best color-depositing conditioners come in. If you want to keep your chosen hue looking vibrant, a color-depositing conditioner will be your saving grace.</p><p>Color-depositing conditioners are hair conditioners that contain a small amount of pigment. This can preserve and amplify the shade of your hair, and also help to neutralize unwanted brassy tones that are often found in blonde and <a href=# rel=noopener>naturally gray hair</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How often should you use color-depositing conditioner?</h2><p>It’s really up to you how often you want to use a color-depositing conditioner. If you wash your hair every day, you might want to save the best color-depositing conditioners for use just once of twice a week. On the other hand, using it every day is perfectly safe — and if you love the results, why not use it every time?</p><p>Whether you use a color-depositing conditioner in place of your regular daily conditioner, or more sparingly, adding one of the best color-depositing conditioners to your routine can make you look like you stepped out of the salon, even when it’s been a while since your last visit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you make your own color-depositing conditioner?</h2><p>It stands to reason: If the best color-depositing conditioners are simply regular conditioners mixed with a little bit of semi-permanent hair dye, can’t you just make your own? However, it’s not that simple. While it may seem like a tempting and cost-effective DIY, it’s a safe bet that you’ll regret whipping up your own mixture in the long run.</p><p>Semi-permanent hair dyes, while safe to use on hair, contain drying alcohols and acids that can throw off the blend of emollient ingredients found in regular conditioners. At best, you’ll end up with a mixture that adds a small amount of pigment to the hair but barely hydrates it. And at worst, you could end up creating a chemically unbalanced concoction that actually damages your hair, leaving it frizzy and dry.</p><p>Sticking with the best color-depositing conditioners will help you avoid a failed science experiment and keep your locks looking lovely. And since we’ve rounded them up for you, finding the perfect one for you couldn’t be any easier!</p><p>To get the best results, use a conditioner specifically formulated to add color to the hair — their ingredients are designed to work together. Not sure where to start looking? <strong>Keep scrolling to shop our picks for the best color-depositing conditioners, guaranteed to keep your hair color dark, vibrant, and fade-free.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best color-depositing conditioner to use in 2021?</h2><ul class=number><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Black Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">dpHue Color Boosting GLOSS+ Deep Conditioning Treatment</a></li><li>Best Drugstore Color-Depositing Conditioner for Brunette Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Visibly Deeper Color Deepening Conditioner</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Brown Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Aveda Clove Color Conditioner</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Chocolate brown Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">One’n Only One N Only Argan Oil Condition Color Chocolate</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Auburn Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Davines Alchemic Conditioner Tobacco</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Red Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">CHI Ionic Illuminate Mahogany Red Color Conditioner</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Copper Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Celeb Luxury Gem Lites Colorditioner</a></li><li>Best Bold Color-Depositing Conditioner : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Celeb Luxury Viral Colorditioner: Professional Color Depositing Conditioner</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Blonde Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Drybar</strong> Blonde Ale Brightening Conditioner</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Ash Blonde Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Shu Uemura Color Lustre Cool Shades Reviving Hair Balm</a></li><li>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Gray Hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Keracolor Clenditioner Color Depositing Conditioner Colorwash</a></li></ul><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">dpHue Color Boosting GLOSS+ Deep Conditioning Treatment</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Black Hair</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/11.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy on Sephora ($35)</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Keeps dark hair vibrant</li><li>Adds depth and gloss</li></ul><p>Is your black hair starting to look a little lackluster?

It makes my gray streaks look blonde and the rest of my auburn hair look rich and shiny. I look like I paid hundreds in the salon for a weave of highlights. In fact, I have not colored my auburn hair in over a year thanks to John Frieda products. I use all the brunette products. I use the color deepener a couple times a week, the brilliant brunette color glaze daily, the luxurious volume treatment a couple of times a week, and I love all the John Frieda shampoo / conditioners.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Aveda Clove Color Conditioner</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Brown Hair</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/3.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy on Nordstrom ($26)</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Smells amazing</li><li>Leaves hair super soft</li></ul><p>Looking for a quick way to give your brunette hair a boost?

While it doesn’t cover grays, it softens and blends them. It conditions my fine hair perfectly. I usually put conditioner on my mid-hair to ends, but because I want to blend roots I start from the roots and go to ends. I use a wet brush in the shower to distribute and let sit for maybe five minutes before rinsing. I end up with deep chocolate hair that feels fuller with more swish than usual.

After just one use, this conditioner immediately deepened and warmed up my color from dark ash blonde to a light dusty brown, and a second use to a light warm brown. The product itself is a rich, true brown color (not green- or purple-based, a true chocolate brown) and has a floral scent. It does not smell like dye like some color-depositors do. My white hairs look sandy and blend well. I would recommend either wearing gloves or immediately washing hands after application, otherwise I have not experienced any unwanted staining.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Davines Alchemic Conditioner Tobacco</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner for Auburn Hair</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/4.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy on Amazon ($31)</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Brightens up red tones</li><li>Infuses rich brown tones</li></ul><p>Continuing with the red hues, auburn hair is easier to maintain thanks to its brown undertones, but it still needs help.

Whether it’s your whole head or highlights, having blonde hair is tricky. Achieving a blonde shade typically doesn’t come with dye but with bleach and toner, so instead of worrying about the color running down the drain with each wash, you’re faced with a different problem: brassiness. Brassiness can occur for various reasons, but primarily occurs once the toner in your hair wears off. To keep your blonde hair from turning an unflattering shade of orange-y yellow, Blonde Ale conditions and tones hair with violet pigments to counteract those warm shades, ensuring your hair remains the right shade of blonde, each time.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> “I love this shampoo and conditioner … my hair was getting a rusty blonde until I used this product.
