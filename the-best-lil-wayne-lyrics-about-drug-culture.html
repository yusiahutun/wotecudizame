Filled with remorse and self-reflection, the song details the consequences of his actions, ultimately relating drug culture to a life filled with pain, danger, and regret. His lyrics "I think I'm dieing / I swear I'm dieing / Heartbeat slow / Like a turtle climbing" capture the physical and emotional toll of addiction.Lil Wayne's exploration of drug culture in his lyrics offers an unfiltered look into a world that often goes unnoticed or misunderstood by many.
