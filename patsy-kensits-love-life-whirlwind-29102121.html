[but] I was with Jim, and Lennon's dad for years, so I kind of count them as my two marriages."</p><p>She added: "I know that's not allowed, I know there was a ceremony. But I feel that those were the really significant relationships and very, very deep and wonderful in so many ways."</p><p>Speaking to The Mirror, Patsy also praised Liam and Jim saying: "Most importantly I have two wonderful sons who have fantastic relationships with their dads.

Liam was very young and I could also see the temptations surrounding him. I wasn’t naive about how intoxicating it can be – and it was all new to Liam."</p><p>However, Liam would go on to have a fling with Lisa Moorish, with who he welcomed a daughter called Molly in 1998.</p><p>Patsy and Liam later split in 2000, with Patsy saying she "regretted" ending the relationship, but they have remained good friends.</p><h3>Jeremy Healey</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29102972.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/5_VARIOUS-STARS-LONDON-BRITAIN-JUN-1999.jpg><p>Patsy's fourth marriage was to superstar DJ Jeremy Healy, who the actress first met in 2007.</p><p>After two years of dating, the couple tied the knot in 2009. However the marriage was not to last, and rumours of a split began to circulate just one year later.</p><p>A spokesperson said at the time: "Patsy and Jeremy remain committed to making their marriage work. Spending this time apart has always been part of Jeremy’s work schedule and on his return they are going to spend some time working things through."</p><p>Patsy and Jeremy later divorced, with a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> at the time: "Patsy has tried everything to make it work but it’s over.
