She was titled as the first woman in NCAA Division I history on 22nd November 2022. She is just an 18-year-old student (as of 2022) who first began playing baseball at five. Despite being a female, she continued playing baseball in the male-dominated team at her school and college.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Olivia Pichardo is only 18 years old and was brought up by her loving and caring parents, Monita Mui-Pichardo and Maximo Pichardo.

She participated in baseball walk-on tryouts, followed by a long week of practicing and an assessment period. Eventually, this practice with the current team and the rigorous sweating during the games made her clinch a spot on the roster for the 2023 season, which will begin in February 2023. This is a proud moment for the NCAA Division I level because there have been many girls playing in the country to lead the sports, and only 20 of them have reached the position as a member of collegiate baseball rosters at various schools. Among them, eight are up for the session of 2023, but none are up for the NCAA Division I level.</p><h3>Olivia Pichardo Career&nbsp;</h3><p>Olivia began playing baseball at the age of five, but at that time, she could hear her parents talking about the place of women in baseball and the future scenarios. In reality, there were no more spots available in the game. Therefore, Olivia began with a lob ball instead of a T-ball. As per her website, she remembers when she was taught to pitch herself because all the pitchers were too tired to throw the ball.
