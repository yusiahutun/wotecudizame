If Cher could really turn back time, what former lover would she want to be with?
In an interview with Mail on Sunday, the pop icon spoke about her previous relationships with famous men, such as Val Kilmer, Gene Simmons, and most notably Tom Cruise. Cher explained that while she met Cruise in 1985 at Madonna and Sean Penn's  wedding, they really connected during their next meeting where they bonded over having dyslexia."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"We didn't go out till way later, but there definitely was a connection there."</p><p>The "Believe" singer <a href=#><strong>has previously mentioned</strong></a> that the "Mission Impossible" star was one of her "top five" lovers of all time, but his allegiance to Scientology was something that didn't fly with her.</p><p>"Though I don't get what he does, that whole Scientology thing," Cher said. "I can't understand it so I just... don't."</p><p>Although Cruise might have been one of her top lovers, it was Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker who she dated from 1986 to 1989, that she said was "possibly the one true love of [her] life."</p><p>As for Kilmer, who Cher dated from 1982 to 1984, the singer said that his smooching skills particularly stood out.</p><p>"When we kissed, I thought my head would shoot right off my body," she recalled.</p><p>Cher told the publication that Simmons, who she was linked to from 1973 to 1974, was the one that she's "crazy" about. The "Mamma Mia Here We Go Again" star only had kind things to say about her relationship with Bon Jovi guitarist <a href=#><strong>Richie Sambora</strong></a>, who she said is "one of the most underrated singers ever."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0e16ae17-5ee5-5c42-9a70-440422778fd9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:20109115-f172-56d9-8fbb-8f16434f3510 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/5by4/2018/09/07/7507de4d82f15da1b0cf6ed3030f750e_xs.jpeg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Cher Shares Secret to Her Butt, MAGA Death Threats, Why She's 'Not a Cher Fan' and More on 'Ellen'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Although Cher confessed that she is still "sweet" on her most of her exes, she didn't have the greatest experiences in her marriages to Gregg Allman and <a href=#><strong>Sonny Bono</strong></a>.</p><p>The "Bang Bang" singer revealed that her marriage to Allman was difficult because of his drug use.</p><p>"It was really intense, but it's hard to have a marriage with someone who's doing drugs," Cher said. "Drugs and I were just never meant to be together. I thought it was stupid and still do. I saw too many people where it ruined their lives. It ruined Gregory's life."</p><p>As for Bono, who Cher was married to from 1969 to 1975, she said that he treated her "more like a golden goose" than a wife.</p><p>"We had a weird relationship," she said. "I don't expect anybody to understand it."</p><p>The Grammy winner gave insight into her current love life as well -- she's currently single and doesn't have a boyfriend "this week."</p><p>"I'm still on the lookout," Cher said. "The problem I have with all the boyfriends lately is that I don't want to go any place with them because you can't keep a relationship going in this kind of goldfish bowl, where everything you do and every picture you have taken will be on Instagram. There's no way to keep something special."</p><p>Cher, 72, also confirmed to the publication that she's had plastic surgery.</p><p>"Yes, I've had a facelift, but who hasn't?" she joked.</p><p>Got a story or a tip for us?
