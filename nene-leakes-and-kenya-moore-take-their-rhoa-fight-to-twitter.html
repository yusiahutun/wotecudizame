NeNe Leakes and Kenya Moore had to be kept apart by show producers and security guards on Sunday's explosive episode of &#34;The Real Housewives of Atlanta,&#34; but no one was around to restrict the online jabs that took place immediately after.
Following the bloodbath -- which stemmed from this season's biggest storyline, SnakeGate -- the reality star nemeses took aim at each other on Twitter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You had the floor!" Kenya shouted, prompting NeNe to fire back, "You shut the f--k up, bitch!"

You're not a victim, blow-up booty," Leakes later told the camera, talking about Moore. "Don't make me have to stick a pin in that fake butt and push the air out, okurrr?"</p><p>Kenya responded on Twitter, writing, "Does she own a mirror?
