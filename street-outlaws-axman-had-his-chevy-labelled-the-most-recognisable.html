Larry currently owns a 1963 Chevy II which features a giant axe on the bonnet and another on the rear deck lid.</p><p>After running N/T radial N/T events for two years, Roach gave up the small tires for big ones and has found his home in the no prep world.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LOU⚡405 Photo (@lou405photo)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=axman-moved-to-drag-racing-for-the-unlimited-money>Axman moved to drag racing for the “unlimited money”</h2><p>During a No Prep interview, Larry opened up about why he moved to drag racing, and he wasn’t afraid to be brutally honest, he explained:</p><p>Really, what got me to switch over was that radial tire racing was just unlimited money. It was who was willing to blow their shit up and put another engine in right there on the spot was going to win.</p>Larry Roach<p>Axman’s views on racing began to change and he realised he wanted to do it as a hobby, simply because he loved it and enjoyed racing. He went on to say:</p><p>That’s what I told myself – from now on, that’s the way racing was going to be. I don’t want to hate going racing. I love it because it’s my hobby, and that’s what I wanna keep it at.</p>Larry Roach<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chopaholic (@streetchopaz)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=his-passion-for-racing-started-at-10-years-old>His passion for racing started at 10 years old</h2><p>Racing has always been in Axman’s blood as his passion originally blossomed when he was just 10, after watching his cousins race around that age.</p><p>As he grew older, he started working on cars, eventually building his own 1972 Nova. Around the same time, he met Brent Austin, driver of the Megalodon 1969 Camaro. Roach recalled:</p><p>I watched Brent at New London Dragstrip. He did an eighth-mile burnout in the raggediest old Nova you’ve ever seen in your life, and it had a blown big block in it. Listening to that blower, I couldn’t believe it. I bumped into Brent where he worked at, and just by talking to him, he asked who was building my engines. At the time, I was doing it myself. I didn’t know anything about a blower. So he took me under his wing, built my motor, basically a whole car and everything.</p>Larry Roach<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH STREET OUTLAWS: AFTER HOURS ON DISCOVERY EVERY TUESDAY AT 8 PM</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOrKurnZWperDB06WYsKtdlsWurc1mn5qcXZ22tHnCoZyvsV2hrqOxy6WcnWWknbJuuc6sq2aqlZi8qLrIrJibpJU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
