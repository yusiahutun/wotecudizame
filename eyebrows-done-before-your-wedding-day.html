Have <a class=hm-link href=#>celebrities such as Michelle Keegan and Coleen Rooney inspired you to get your&nbsp;brows&nbsp;microbladed</a>? When should they be waxed, or tinted, or even laminated? So many options, but it's whatever works for you. We reached out to the experts to tell us everything.&nbsp;</p><h2>Option 1: Microblading before your wedding day</h2><p id=ePdpS1PWWIHE data-wc=27>If you're not blessed with <strong>Cara Delevingne</strong>-style brows, your sparse brows might be a frustration. We went to see award-winning celebrity brow artist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Liarna Jessica</a> for her top tips.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_mjUw9ahoBN data-wc=27>Liarna, who you can find at&nbsp;Liarna Jessica London in Chelsea, says getting your <a class=hm-link href=#>eyebrows microbladed</a> could be a strong option for any bride-to-be who's worried about her brows.&nbsp;</p><p id=epCHYi9ogT5c data-wc=2><strong>FIND OUT:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The dos and don'ts of wedding skincare</a></p><p id=eeRaZ1v2XSAs data-wc=45>"Microblading is an increasingly popular (celebrity-endorsed) permanent cosmetic procedure, where we use a tiny handheld tool with ultra-fine little needles on the tips to manually implant pigment into the skin in the form ultra-fine hairstrokes," Liarna said. "They look incredibly natural and simulate real hair."&nbsp;</p><p id=e55zXPVPmIlQ data-wc=38>Liarna explained that the procedure is perfect for your big day as&nbsp;it's low maintenance because you simply won't have to touch your brows: "The shape is created for you…if you have asymmetrical brows, we can correct it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f79b0cd58ed4-microblading-z.jpg><p id=eFoRE3WWDBlZ data-wc=8><strong>Liarna's microblading skills&nbsp;- see more&nbsp;on Instagram</strong> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>@liarna_jessica_london</a></p><p id=eXXI3OmAzmeX data-wc=49>Your makeup artist won't have to spend time filling in your brows, with your perfect brows already created, your face will be the ideal canvas for wedding day makeup application. But it's also the prep before the wedding and after that can see this procedure being a bridal favourite.</p><p id=ezKDtx-XX-47 data-wc=49>Liarna revealed her blissfully married clients said it was a game changer for&nbsp;the honeymoon. "Throw your brow pencils away! If you're planning on visiting the pool or the beach, feel free to take a dip. Your brows will still be there when you resurface, making you look amazing!"</p><h3>How long before the wedding should you get your brows microbladed?</h3><p id=exHKHfglcsVV data-wc=11>Liarna recommends three months, as the procedure is a two-part process.</p><p id=eX6P09dPqMcY data-wc=110>"You have the initial treatment where we design the shape to suit your face and hair colour. We also thread and tweeze the hair, before or after the procedure, so that the hair is nice and groomed and neat. Once your brows have healed from the initial treatment, you need to come back for a second treatment. This is to make sure that any parts of the brows that need more colour can get retouched. This retouching appointment will take place 4-6 weeks after the first appointment, so you need to make sure you allow at least three months for your full procedure to be completed before your big day."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/96abfd286c29-lading-z.jpg><p id=epheR-tXc1P1 data-wc=6><strong>Microbladed brows take time to heal</strong></p><h2>Option 2: Eyebrow threading before your wedding day</h2><p id=eIA6VY-3Gnl4 data-wc=58>According to a leading brow technician at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Brow Bar London</a>, it's&nbsp;advised to have a consultation with your therapist at least two months before the big day. In this session, you can&nbsp;assess the look that you are trying to achieve and the best treatments to create the desired look. If you decide to have them threaded, redness might occur.</p><p id=eaQZ5NL2w0Df data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How to do your own wedding makeup: Tips from pros at Charlotte Tilbury, Bobbi Brown and MAC</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c3c9d36a227-threading-z.jpg><p id=eV5K8Cx7EpII data-wc=6><strong>Eyebrow threading before your wedding day</strong></p><p id=eFgDiqOKGzfT data-wc=32>"As with any form of hair removal, redness is the biggest potential side effect after threading.&nbsp;Redness typically subsides within an hour however you can help calm things down with anti-inflammatory cream."</p><h2>Option 3: Eyebrow waxing before your wedding day</h2><p id=ed8rIXV-0sVk data-wc=46>Eyebrow waxing is a method of removing unwanted hair, using either cold or hot wax. Waxing is quick and effective particularly on thicker bushy brows, it also provides a smooth finish as it removes dead skin cells around the brow area which makes makeup application seamless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e72b0ace80d-waxing-z.jpg><p id=efb1cLaltG_1 data-wc=6><strong>Eyebrow waxing is quick and effective</strong></p><p id=eu2sfRJQR_BZ data-wc=41>Our expert at Brow Bar London said: "By waxing your eyebrows at least, a day or two ahead of time, you will give your skin time to calm down and cool off so that you are less likely to exacerbate irritation."</p><h2>Option 4: Eyebrow lamination before your wedding day</h2><p id=eYLzHo5Qf6vo data-wc=55>"Eyebrow lamination is the most popular procedure that focuses on creating shiny, smooth brows. Essentially a perm for your brows,&nbsp;it's a treatment that&nbsp;gives them a set, uniform shape for an extended period of time. Instead of curls, a setting lotion helps brow hair stay brushed up and lifted upward for about 6/7 weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/293625f56d64-eyebrow-lamination-z.jpg><p id=et5es_eOEpb3 data-wc=6><strong>Eyebrow lamination for smooth, shiny brows</strong></p><p id=e-DJiBcopcM_ data-wc=65>For the first 24 hours after the treatment, you should treat your brows with care, avoiding getting them wet, steam baths and saunas. After this time, you can treat them normal, simply brushing them into place every morning with a brush. We recommend opting for this treatment at least 2 days before a party or an event, during this period the colour becomes more natural."</p><h2>Option 5: Eyebrow tinting before your wedding day</h2><p id=e9P0DA7yjpaz data-wc=27>Brow Bar London recommend a consultation with your therapist at least two months before the day for any brow treatment, where you can try out the results.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7f85ef9c9ae-eyebrowtint-z.jpg><p id=efBqOr9OCVnb data-wc=6><strong>Eyebrow tinting before your wedding day</strong></p><p id=eBp-7B1JYh0M data-wc=32>"Once you are happy with the results and we know the exact plan-the next step will be scheduling your appointment with your therapist three&nbsp;days before your wedding to repeat the treatment."</p><p id=eyVsVqRDoVsv data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>7 surprising legalities you need to know before getting married</a></p><p id=enQAwlvAK8TD data-wc=23><strong>Planning your wedding?
