A statement released by her family said she “passed away yesterday at her home in London after a short illness.” She was 83. The statement reads:</p><p>“Annie was a pioneer, trailblazer, and an inspiration to many,” said the statement. “Her impulse to share that enthusiasm with audiences remained undimmed after six decades of broadcasting on BBC TV and radio globally.</p><p>“Never underestimate the role model she became. Breaking down doors by refusing to bow down to sexual prejudice and male fear encouraged generations of young women who, like Annie, only wanted to tell you about an amazing tune they had just heard. Watching Annie do this on television in the 1970s, most famously as a presenter on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, or hearing her play the latest breakbeat techno on Radio One is testimony to someone who never stopped believing in the magic of rock ‘n’ roll.”</p><p>Nightingale joined BBC in 1970 and was on the air until late last year with her program, Annie Nightingale Presents. She was the network’s longest-running DJ, and for over a decade, she was the only woman on Radio 1 until 1982, when Janice Long joined the team, according to Musicweek.com.</p><p>Born in England (Middlesex) in 1940, Nightingale started her journalism career before she joined BBC Radio 1. She was known for her love of all genres of music – advocating everything from punk rock to progressive rock to grime. She was ageless in that she adapted adeptly to the changing times and the changing industry with undimmed enthusiasm.</p><p>Nightingale presented a range of shows on the radio and was also the host of BBC Two’s The Old Grey Whistle Test, a 1970s/1980s music show that featured non-chart hits in opposition to BBC One’s Top of the Pops.</p><p>Tributes have poured in all over after news of her death was announced.</p><p><strong>Aled Haydn Jone – Head of Radio 1: </strong>“All of us at Radio 1 are devastated to lose Annie. Our thoughts are with her family and friends. “Annie was a world-class DJ, broadcaster, and journalist, and throughout her entire career, was a champion of new music and new artists. She was the first female DJ on Radio 1, and over her 50 years on the station, she was a pioneer for women in the industry and in dance music. We have lost a broadcasting legend, and thanks to Annie, things will never be the same.”</p><p><strong>Zoe Ball – BBC Radio 2 Presenter:</strong> “She loved music like no other; she sought out the tunes and artists that shaped our lives; she interviewed them all, opening doors for musicians, DJs, and broadcasters alike.”</p><p><strong>Annie Mac&nbsp; – Former BBC DJ,</strong> via Instagram: “What a devastating loss. Annie Nightingale was a trailblazer, spirited, adventurous, fearless, hilarious, smart, and so good at her job. This is the woman who changed the face and sound of British TV and radio broadcasting forever. You can’t underestimate it.”</p><p>In 2002, Nightingale was awarded an MBE for her services to radio broadcasting. In 2004, she was inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. She holds the world record for having the longest career as a female radio presenter. She marked her 50th anniversary in broadcasting at Radio 1 in 2020 with a series of BBC specials.</p><p>Nightingale was also an accomplished author, publishing three memoirs: Chase the Fade (1981), Wicked Speed (1999), and Hey Hi Hello.</p><p>The Annie Nightingale Presents Scholarship was launched by Radio 1 last year. The initiative is designed to champion up-and-coming women and non-binary DJs in dance music.</p><p>The family statement said a memorial service celebrating her life will take place in the Spring. Her family is requesting privacy at this time and is signed by Alex, Lucy, Ollie, and Will.</p><p>RIP.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoaGtnoJ68r7HEq6Cnn12btrO%2F02adnqWRobJursGcZKuZlJ68bn2MnaFmmZ6jtqZ5zaKeoayZo7SiuMRmm6Kdo2KutXmXbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
