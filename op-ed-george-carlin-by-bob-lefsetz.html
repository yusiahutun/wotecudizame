As I<br>watched him stride the stage with his mic, I thought what a great job this<br>was. You get an agent to book the gig, you drive to the venue from your<br>house, you do your show and you take ALL THE MONEY!</p><p>I'm sure George loved that. After all, he invented the format. Oh, the<br>Borscht Belt comedians preceded him, but George wasn't a member of that<br>club, hell, he wasn't even Jewish. He didn't depend on favors from singers,<br>and he had a gold-selling record career. George Carlin didn't tell jokes,<br>he specialized in the TRUTH! And one thing the baby boomers recognized was<br>the truth. They flocked to George. Once he gave up trying to please their<br>parents and just said what he felt on the inside.</p><p>I can't remember whether it was '67 or '68, but around seven o'clock on a<br>Sunday evening, with school still in session, my parents dropped me off at<br>Sacred Heart University for a concert. One of those five act extravaganzas<br>like the one featuring the Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield, the Soul<br>Survivors and…that I went to at Fairfield University the fall before. The<br>headliner was Vanilla Fudge. Actually, I saw Carmine Appice a couple of<br>weeks back at the Kenny Chesney show. Playing second was Connecticut's<br>biggest local act, NAIF, the North Atlantic Invasion Force, but in the<br>middle, on around nine, was the performance I truly remember. George Carlin<br>took the stage. Did the Hippy-Dippy Weatherman. He was funny. I kept my<br>eye on him. When he exploded in the seventies it wasn't news, but the<br>preordained success of someone who worked hard, bucking the system to<br>ultimately be successful in another system, that of youth culture.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/george-carlin-podiumlefsetz.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Sure, he was about ten or fifteen years older than his new audience, but he<br>was seen as one of them. A God. Quoted ad infinitum from his Little David<br>records.</p><p>Seinfeld's observational comedy? That's all derived from Carlin. I don't<br>want to hassle Jerry here, he admits it. Carlin was the first to look at<br>our screwed up world and question it. The only comedian doing this today is<br>Chris Rock. Cable TV killed live comedy and while everybody with a modicum<br>of talent looked to star in, or write for, a sitcom, today's generation was<br>subjected to the inanities of Dane Cook. A harmless gentleman, but that's<br>just the point… Dane's about jokes. Carlin was much more than jokes, he<br>actually inspired people to think, to question.</p><p>Save the planet? SAVE YOURSELF!</p><p>I think of Carlin's routine every time I hear people pontificate about the<br>environment. George said the planet's been around for millions of years, it<br>will survive. Isn't that an interesting thought? An Earth without people?<br>Instead of thinking about whether your kids will get cancer, think of human<br>beings going the way of dinosaurs.</p><p>And, of course, the difference between football and baseball… Sudden<br>death and extra innings. The gridiron as opposed to the field. Baseball is<br>a pastoral game…</p><p>And what about the routine about STUFF? Buying stuff, hoarding stuff,<br>moving stuff. As someone addicted to my stuff, I think of George's words<br>whenever I debate throwing something away. Do I really need it? Is my<br>identity really rolled up in my possessions?</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/george-carlin-squint-lefsetz.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>And then there was the Friday night executions. Maybe it was Monday night.<br>But you remember that HBO routine. God, that would generate ratings!<br>Begging the question, would executives put ANYTHING on television if it<br>delivered ratings? In the years since, Carlin seems a seer. Hell, it's<br>almost not a joking matter. They have vigils, TV reports, whenever they<br>execute another inmate.</p><p>From a distance, it looked like George couldn't break through into TV or<br>movies. The obituaries are saying it was his choice. I'd like to agree<br>with this, if you're sui generis, if you're making a difference, can you<br>play any role but yourself?</p><p>I looked forward to those HBO specials.</p><p>I must say, in the recent one, George was a bit off his game. Maybe his<br>health was affecting his talent. Then again, we don't reevaluate Sinatra<br>based on his final tours. Frank's legend was cemented over and over again,<br>from the forties to the sixties. And George Carlin's legend was cemented<br>from the seventies to the nineties. He wasn't the voice of a generation,<br>he'd hate that description, rather he was the trusted observer, removed,<br>sitting on high, taking the pulse of a nation.</p><p>You might say he was secondary to Richard Pryor. I love Richard, but their<br>acts were different. Richard was a storyteller nonpareil. Carlin's talent<br>lay in his insight, in questioning what the fuck was going on through humor.</p><p>If you look at Carlin's track record, it's akin to the Beatles'. He was<br>more consistent than the Stones, even though he worked just as long. And<br>even though we loved his greatest hits, we always wanted to hear his new<br>stuff. Carlin wasn't calcified, he was positively alive.</p><p>Sure, he took drugs to cope. But, he also had a wife and a child and a<br>level of normalcy that left him out of the "Behind The Music"/"E! True<br>Hollywood Story" exposes. With Carlin, it wasn't about the drugs, but the<br>talent. We marveled at the talent.</p><p>It's funny when a guy like Carlin dies. Because he still lives. Not only<br>all those HBO specials and records, but the routines in our minds. He's<br>changed our lives. You see, Carlin's comedy never got dated. Because being<br>human never really changes.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/george-carlin-star-lefsetz.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> But now Carlin is gone. Kinda weird, because he was an inspiration, a<br>beacon for all us wannabe truth tellers. If Carlin could do it, maybe we<br>could too. Now, the path is only illuminated by his legacy, there will be<br>no more new words, no more new routines. No more appearances on late night<br>TV where he questions the conventional wisdom, where he states he doesn't<br>vote because it doesn't make a difference. I'm a big believer in casting my<br>ballot, but I can see that George is right. The fat cats win no matter<br>what. The little guy is squeezed out. George was not a star who wanted to<br>live above the fray, he never forgot his roots, he was interested in the<br>little guy, and the little guy loved him for it.</p><p>Everybody I know who interacted with Carlin said they had a conversation.<br>His stardom did not eviscerate his humanity. But his poor heart stopped him<br>cold.</p><p>Seventy one is too young to die. Seems old, but when you get there, or see<br>that a man running for President is that age, you realize that as a<br>septuagenarian, you've still got a lot of living to do. Hopefully.</p><p>George's candle has been snuffed out, but his memory will live on. If I<br>think of my pantheon of inspirations, I put him right up there with Tom<br>Wolfe and Frank Zappa. Wolfe the observer and Zappa the questioner. That's<br>what George Carlin was. An observer who was not afraid to question the<br>status quo. I will be continued to be inspired by him. Hopefully, you will<br>too.</p><p>I had just gotten in at my place of employment at the time which was the<br>afternoon / night shift at Tower Records on the Sunset Strip, I was 22 and<br>the year was 1972, while walking over to my section of the store, my section<br>was the comedy section… meaning I had to take records from the under stock<br>and make sure that they were represented in the display up on top, I look<br>and I see one Mr. George Carlin looking through my section. Now George was<br>at the top of his game at the time, he and his manager had just started<br>their own record company called "Little David Records" for which the only<br>other artist on the label at the time was a little known jazz / folk singer<br>named Kenny Rankin….. sorry to say but at that time he wasn't my cup of<br>tea but still I had received a promo of his album and gave it a listen which<br>said a lot because I used to take albums I had no use for directly over to<br>Aaron's Records, for those of you who don't know Aaron's Records was a place<br>on Melrose Ave. here in Los Angeles where you could take your used and new<br>albums and turn them into $$$$$$…. something that was in short supply in<br>those days. Tower Records was never known for paying their employees a lot<br>of money, I think they figured with all the free records, tee shirts,<br>concert and let's not forget the store groupies… you were doing pretty<br>well. I didn't complain I had no bills to pay except for rent.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/class-clown-lefsetz.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>OK back to George, so I walked up to him and I tell George how I've been<br>listening to his new LP "Class Clown" religiously and playing it in the<br>store until all of the other employees were sick of it, I know how many<br>times can you listen to the same joke over and over again. Sorry but I loved<br>it and for me it was a learning experience. I asked George joking "would you<br>please show me how you do your Ed Sullivan" and much to my surprise he<br>showed me by saying. "By now you know, by now you know, just before the<br>aero photography picture of Kate Smith, Topo Gigio the little faggot mouse<br>will be out here to do his thing". Even thought I'd heard it before on<br>record I laugh so hard that I cried.</p><p>So we talked for a while. Lets face it George always was one of us…. just<br>peopl,e none of that movie star crap for him… and that's what we all loved<br>him for.</p><p>He had a boxed set (stay with me now, this is where the story gets good) of<br>classical LP's under his arm and asked me "do you have a LP resealer in the<br>back room of the store?"…. we were told by Tower management never to<br>mention the LP resealer, it was Tower's dirty little secret and you could<br>get fired for that on the spot, so without so much as thinking twice I said<br>"yeah we have one." He said to me that he was flying to New York tonight<br>and that tomorrow was his friend's birthday and wouldn't it be funny if when<br>his friend opened up the LP he found some drugs inside it instead of LP's. I<br>said "ABSOLUTELY I WOULD", so we proceeded to the back room of Tower Records<br>where we heated up the shrink wrap machine and opened up the box set of LP's<br>that he had and took the albums out of the box and at that point I was<br>thinking maybe he had a little pot to put inside, but George was the big<br>time and there it was…. WOW … George reaches into his pants and pulls<br>out the biggest bag of cocaine I had ever seen in my life… so we proceeded<br>to put the bag of coke into the box set and as I thought … "sorry George"<br>it wouldn't fit, no problem he said and he opens up the baggy and puts a big<br>pile of coke on the record sleeve, puts the bag back into the box set and it<br>still wouldn't fit, so George take some more out and we finally get the bag<br>to fit, we send it through the resealer and shrink wrapper until the LP<br>looked just like new. George thanked me very much and I inquired "what about<br>that pile of coke sitting there" he said "no problem, that's for you for<br>your services" You've got to be joking…."no, that's for you" :):):):) I<br>was used to buying small amounts and never had that much for personal use<br>ever…I said "Thanks George !!!!!!" I clean up everything in the back<br>room and walk him out to the front entrance shook his hand and thanked him<br>for everything…. for me a banner day at Tower.</p><p>Needless to say I was employee of the month and had this great story to tell<br>all.</p><p>In closing I'm not glorifying drug use because as of this month I celebrated<br>my 18th year of being sober and don't care to make any judgment on anybody<br>that still gets high…</p><p>THATS YOUR BUSINESS !!!! Enjoy your life. "I hope he did". George Carlin is<br>the true template of comedy for all to follow.

He had a<br>nice suite of offices in Brentwood with his older brother Patrick in one<br>office & that (now late) brilliant comic/writer Pat McCormick also based<br>there. He and George were working together.</p><p>Among the projects I did with him was a live call-in national radio special<br>for "Rockline" aired on over 100 album rock formatted stations. This was<br>the first (and maybe only) time they had a comedian guest for the entire<br>program and the audience reaction was unbelievable. He was great — gave<br>autographs, took pix, did station id's and quipped hysterically about<br>everything.<br>Lastly, among all the tributes and obits, everyone seems to have forgotten<br>that he sub-hosted for Johnny Carson on the Tonight show wearing a T-shirt.<br>Only HE could get away with this & do it with unquestioned class and style<br>along with his absolute brilliance.</p><p>Ron Farber</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>School year 1970-71, myself and three high school friends who were all at<br>UCLA, rented a two-bedroom apartment on Beverly Glen. Who was our next door<br>neighbor, but George Carlin. It was in his transition phase, when he was<br>fired from Las Vegas. He wasn't around much. He liked the Mad Dogs and<br>Englishmen poster I had up in our living room wall, and sometimes we would<br>talk about music. He drove a Trans-Am. Brenda, his wife, seemed lonely.<br>Quite often the apartment door was open. Sometimes after class she would<br>invite me in for a beer, which I thought was strange as I was underage, and<br>to chat. I liked her. Their daughter Kelly was very young, and they had a<br>small dog, Bogie.</p><p>Months later I saw him play at the Troubadour, and popped backstage to say<br>hello. When he learned that I didn't have his new album, AM/FM,<br>(unbeknownst to me) he sent Brenda to Tower Records to buy one and gave it<br>to me later that night. I was touched. In addition to being much older<br>than I, he was a hard guy to be friends with because he was on the road so<br>much. I did a few stories on him, including one for the L.A. Times where I<br>traveled to Vegas. It was memorable to me because I came up with the lyrics<br>to "Punk Rock Christmas" while sweating in the summer heat around the hotel<br>pool, jotting them on the Newsweek I was reading. I visited him once more<br>when he lived on Pacific Ave. in Venice.</p><p>I spoke with him last in the Nineties. He called me because he had gotten<br>the rights back to his Little David albums and was thinking of manufacturing<br>his catalogue himself, which he did. A few years later, Jeff Gold came to<br>us about wanting to issue comedy compilations to tie in with the new laugh<br>therapy coming from India. Foos thought we needed a spokesperson for such a<br>line and wanted me to call George. He was lukewarm on the project, which we<br>never did.</p><p>Harold Bronson</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Hi Bob:</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/life-is-worth-losing.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>George Carlin was one of the nicest people I ever knew. I will miss his<br>humor, and the rare talks we would have over the years about comedy, music,<br>family and life.</p><p>I met him in 1983 as he was in the comeback mode after years battling<br>addiction and health issues. He had just released an album called CARLIN ON<br>CAMPUS, and I was the young promotion man working it at radio in the North<br>East and I was about 21 years old.</p><p>I remember calling his office, because I had a ton of AOR radio programmers<br>and morning show producers calling me to get a shot at an interview or a<br>live on the air visit to the many stations that were playing his first album<br>on his own label called EARDRUM RECORDS.</p><p>Again, I was a kid, a huge fan, and I called his office and this guy<br>answered the phone, and I said something like "Hi, this is Joe Reagoso and I<br>have some radio requests around the new project, and I was calling to see if<br>Mr. Carlin would be available to give us some help………etc." Then this<br>person who answered the phone said something to the effect of "No problem,<br>Joey…..I will ask Mr. Carlin and get back with you." I gave the fellow my<br>information, and then I asked him his name and he said "This is George<br>Carlin." I almost died. Here is my favorite comedian in life calling me<br>"Joey" and actually speaking with me and clowning around.</p><p>We met at Lafeyette University near Allentown PA, in a school locker room<br>after the show, his backstage area.<br>We talked about the album, radio op's, retail stuff, and then the topics<br>shifted to the likes of Rudy Ray Moore, Redd Foxx, Lord Buckley, and so<br>on…then family, neighborhoods, music, etc. He always wanted to know how<br>the family was. A very family kinda guy for sure.</p><p>Since I was a student of comedy recordings, he and I became very good<br>friends over the years, exchanging a lot of material, tapes, cds, etc. He<br>at one time sent me a box of cassettes with some of the raunchiest shit I<br>ever heard, and I couldn't stop laughing. I still have some of them in my<br>IPOD and it will always be a reminder who hipped me to the routines. He<br>collected a lot of this stuff, archived it. He had roasts and early<br>beatnick rap stuff, and comedy from all eras.</p><p>For the next three decades, I went to a bunch of his concerts and casino<br>shows. Never using the same material, always a new and fresh presentation,<br>Carlin was a true American original.<br>He taped all of his shows, he analyzed his material, always striving and<br>creating the best he could do, and it worked, look at the run he had. It<br>never peaked, he was always doing something new and challenging for both<br>himself, but more so for his worldwide audience.</p><p>I can cite several shows where even I wanted to shrink and hide, I was so<br>embarrassed. I mean the guy would explore taboos unknown to other comedians<br>or actors. Once he was going into something edgy in Atlantic City, and I<br>was with some family, and I knew it was time to either get the hell out of<br>the place, or just pretend I didn't hear what he just said. I mean the guy<br>knew how to make you laugh, but maybe it wasn't the kind of stuff we should<br>be laughing at….that was the unique quality of his comedy.</p><p>He would call me when he was in a city nearby, and we would hook up at the<br>gigs, and I would usually take a friend or someone in the music field with<br>me, and they would just freak out, because I would never tell them that we<br>were going to meet him. One time, I was at a very very lame MCA Records<br>convention in 1999 in Vegas, and I was flying over the town, and I saw a<br>huge sign "CARLIN at the MGM GRAND".</p><p>I called him as soon as the plane landed and I said I was in town, and he he<br>asked me how many tickets I needed, and I said "I am at this very lame<br>convention, and I have a staff of about 20 folks", and he said<br>"Great….bring them to the gig and then we'll meet up after the show."<br>Well, it was about 120 degrees that night, I snuck about 20 promotion folks<br>out of the convention, and we walked over to the MGM GRAND. I didn't really<br>tell them what we doing up until the moment we left the convention, and they<br>almost shit.</p><p>George, put us all in the first row seating area….and he was doing a very<br>heavy show that night, for a casino, so that made it even more cool, and<br>then as the gig ended, everyone thought we were going back to the<br>convention, but I said, "Hey Guys, we need to walk this way thru the<br>greenroom." So, without telling anyone what was next, we all walked back to<br>the green room area, and George walks out with his usual greeting to me "Hey<br>Joey…You Fuck." The promotion staff went bonkers. They had no idea that<br>I even knew this guy, and here they were now, getting handshakes,<br>autographs, pictures taken with the legend, etc. George was a very nice guy<br>to do things like that, and it wasn't rare. A very nice man indeed.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/jammin-in-ny.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>He actually put my wife and I in one of the final episodes of his George<br>Carlin Show on FOX in the 90's. I will never forget that as long as I live.<br>I called him one time, and asked if he could put me in his show as a bar<br>matron, or whatever, you know…wanting to have something for posterity.<br>Well….we flew into Warner Studios and he brought my wife Karen and I<br>through the whole process. I mean, we were at the production meetings, we<br>saw the writing sessions, the rehearsals, the live audience tapings, the<br>pre-show tapings, etc. The episode featured Tommy Chong, and if you could<br>imagine this shit, George Carlin and Tommy Chong getting a delivery of pot<br>mailed to Carlin's address by mistake….I mean it was a once in a lifetime<br>scripts and t.v. moments. At any rate, he put me and the wife in the bar<br>scene throughout the entire show! Then several transition scenes too, like<br>walking by him on the street and waving hi to us…. It was very heavy for<br>me. I have to be honest with you. I never expected him to give us the<br>royal treatment. I just thought I would be in it for a second or two…..<br>no….you know what George did as well….he put us in the national t.v.<br>commercial announcing the new episode, which ran for a week, and then during<br>the very big Sunday Night Football program on FOX, so everyone I knew in<br>life was calling me in disbelief.</p><p>Disbelief, that is the feeling I have today. I got a call from Michael<br>Lessner at Live Nation, missed the call, opened up my email, and then I got<br>the NY TIMES headline and my heart sunk. Shocked somewhat, numb and bummed<br>out, yes. He was a friend for life. He and I had some very amazing<br>conversations over the years that will live on in my heart and memory for<br>the rest of my life. He was a caring guy, took me under his wing, when I<br>was a kid, and never forgot about me, my family, my friends or my label<br>compadres. He loved music, loved comedy, loved his family. If you knew<br>him, he was the same guy you saw on television, he was a funny funny man.<br>No doubt about it.</p><p>I remember a year ago, you had seen the HBO special, and you were analyzing<br>it, and I sent it over to George. There was a segment in that show called<br>"Uncle Dave", and before he died, probably the last time I saw him in Long<br>Beach, right when I moved here, I told him that this routine was a very<br>heavy piece of comedy that actually brought some tears to my eyes. It was<br>about how the average guy who gets fucked over his whole life, by his boss,<br>by school mates, by his friends, by ill health, by bad shit all around, and<br>then how it happens when you die that all of the great ones come back like<br>Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and all the other "Uncle Daves" finally get<br>their just break. They finally get the pay raise, they finally get<br>recognition, etc. I mean it was like a 45 minute piece in artistry, that I<br>never heard anyone do since or probably never be able to do. I remember<br>telling him how in the beginning, it sounded like a typical funny bit, but<br>then it turns into this serious piece of commentary which takes you to the<br>next level. George stood up for the Uncle Daves in this world. Maybe that<br>is why we all dug the man.</p><p>Georgie….I miss you man! God is watching over you now. May God Bless you<br>and your wonderful family. Our prayers are with you.</p><p>Your old bub,</p><p>Joe Reagoso</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Hey Bob,</p><p>I wanted to drop you a note about the passing of George Carlin. I remember<br>seeing him on TV during his "short hair" years and loving him then a few<br>years later buying my first comedy LP, "Class Clown." During college, I was<br>almost arrested for playing "Occupation: Foole" while working a mall record<br>store.</p><p>In 1990, I was lucky enough to promote two sold out concerts with him up in<br>the Berkshires and spend some quality time getting to know one of my idols.<br>It was the first performances after his heart attack and I had to make sure<br>his chicken for dinner was cooked without the skin. I will never forget the<br>unique, gentle was he described how the heart attack was his wake up call. I<br>don't know what he was personally like before, but when I was with him he<br>was one of the most gentle, polite men – oh he truly felt the anger his<br>routines would bring out in him onstage, but I never heard him complain<br>about anything and he made my crew happy enough to want to work for him for<br>free! He was also one of the most intelligent people I have ever met.</p><p>dan4456</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Bob,</p><p>The mid-late 70's. George Carlin opened/shared the bill with me at the Santa<br>Monica Civic.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/you-are-all-deceased.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Everyone was finally gone & I had to tell my roadie something. Speaking<br>briefly with George in the hallway of the dressing rooms I told him my Wife<br>was kinda spooked being alone back there in the dressing rooms area alone &<br>would he so kindly just say hello & keep her company for a minute while I<br>did my thing with my roadie? "You got it, baby", Carlin says.</p><p>I do my thing with my roadie & equipment, taking much, much, longer than I<br>thought & feeling concerned about my Wife sitting alone & guilty because<br>maybe Carlin got stuck with her, wanting to go home, just to be a nice guy<br>to me. I am hearing talking in the hallway of the dressing rooms. I stood<br>unseen by the door for a couple of minutes where Carlin was sitting on the<br>couch across from my Wife talking to her in great detail about his Wife &<br>Kids & what He & they were going to do the rest of the weekend etc. & asking<br>Her all about Her life, what did She like in life & what was Her opinions<br>about this & that subject in life. He sat there with Her for a damn<br>half-hour which was only intended to be a couple of fast minutes. He knew He<br>was a Star & Famous etc. by then but sat there for a half-hour talking like<br>a "real person-mench" about regular life stuff & truly interested in my<br>Wife's interests & opinions etc. I stood there and listened for a couple of<br>minutes & then walked in apologizing for my long delay & thanking Him for<br>being so kind.</p><p>"No problem, my pleasure man"; He says. "It was a very interesting<br>conversation & She's a very pretty Lady, man"; He concludes. "So what can I<br>do for you Mr. George Carlin?", I asked humorously. "Hey man I'm just a<br>"George" baby! Just a "George!", He says, and walkin away says; "I'm goin<br>home now to "my" pretty Wife (she passed away early in life, devastating,<br>how did he go on?) and you play great, man", he concludes. As well as being<br>grateful elevating my concern about my Wife's safety & comfort, I was blown<br>away & even moved by the humility, warmth, sensitivity, being a real human<br>being & actually not too self-absorbed or narcissistic to actually be<br>honestly interested in another human being who was not "in the business"<br>etc. I asked my Wife about it as we drove home. She said so unaffectedly;<br>"He asked me so many things about me & told me so many things about His Wife<br>& Kids. He's a big star isn't He?" I said, "Yea. The biggest."</p><p>(Famous comedian) opened for me for 3 nights in a club in Philly & I eased<br>into his dressing room & stuck out my hand & introduced myself. He never<br>looked up, said anything or shook my hand. I just walked away.</p><p>When I heard George passed a few tears rolled down my cheek. For Him, for<br>me, my Wife & for the beautiful era & people who existed & exists in the<br>times we of a similar age bracket lived through. How lucky we have been (&<br>still are) & how lucky a guy by the name of George Carlin was here for a<br>while for us to enjoy & even learn from. I'm sure He would say; "Aw. Learned<br>a lot from all of you guys too, man".</p><p>John Klemmer</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Funny (or maybe not) that John McCain seems at least 20 years older than<br>George Carlin.</p><p>Dave Gorman</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>Just thought you'd be interested that I forwarded your letter to Sally</p><p>Carlin, who's reading it as I write.</p><p>My wife Merle is her friend and has been with her all day.</p><p>I'm sure she'll have great solace in such a great testimonial.</p><p>N</p><p>ps she asked that I send it on George's email, which gave me a shiver</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGinoGKypXnGnqarn5VisKK%2By6KlZpqpYq%2BwroylnJ%2BrlanHcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
