The beagle-chihuahua mix has quite a Cinderella story since being adopted by the "Thank U, Next" singer in 2013. He was on the cover of Vogue with Grande, has made an appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," and even starred in ads for the designer brand, Coach. You can also spot Toulouse in the background of many of the "Positions" singer's photos, including in one of her wedding shots.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><a href=#><strong> Billie Eilish</strong></a><strong> and Shark and Pepper</strong></p><p>Billie Eilish adopted a pit bull named Shark when he was just a puppy from the Angel City Pitbulls shelter in Los Angeles.

She has three cats that fans know by name: Benjamin Button, Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey. As Swift posts about the latter the least often, fans became concerned when the cat had not made a social media appearance in months. In response, the "Anti-Hero" singer posted a video to social media that showed her holding up Meredith, explaining that the cat hates getting her picture taken. Then, there was a montage of photos showing a very disgruntled and annoyed Meredith.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a><strong> and Laurelei</strong></p><p>Serena Williams has multiple dogs, but Laurelei was her oldest. The small, white pup recently passed away at 18 years old right before Williams attended her last U.S. Open. She wrote a tribute on Instagram saying, "Lauerlei sadly took her last breath yesterday. I am sad but happy for all the time and all the extra I got to spend with her. She lived a long long life. The last year and a half was a bonus. She got to get anything she ever wanted and she was biting toes till the end. Literally. She LOVED chicken and acrobatics. She was the smallest yet toughest little pup and I will miss herâ€¦ so much. ðŸ’”truly the end of an Era."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a><strong> and Tarzan and Thunder</strong></p><p>Camila Cabello loves herself some labradors. The "Havana" artist has two: Tarzan and Thunder. Tarzan even has his own Instagram (<a href=#>@tarzanadog</a>). Cabello got Tarzan while she was still in her relationship with Shawn Mendes. The former couple shared the dog, and when they split, fans questioned who would keep Tarzan. It seems the "Never Be The Same" singer won that battle.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:13ddf1c1-d7d2-458b-ab15-661782f372b6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:45d3e783-449e-4053-a747-0d3cb8f827ab data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cb/5by4/2022/03/19/cb5581af4ea04807a8c0009988e9b698_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shawn Mendes Reflects On Life After Camila Cabello Split</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>BTS</strong></a><strong> and Their Pets</strong></p><p>Every member of BTS has pets.

Holly is Suga's toy poodle, and the artist is a proud dog dad, commonly mentioning Holly in their variety shows and showing her off on Instagram. Yeontan is band member Vâ€™s black and tan pomeranian. Fans love when the pup makes an appearance whether it be on social media, v-lives, or cameos in short videos at their concerts.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a><strong> and Clyde</strong></p><p>Jennifer Aniston has multiple dogs: Clyde, Chesterfield, and Sophie. However, it can be argued that Clyde is the obvious favorite as he shows up the most on her Instagram and has an animated version of himself that posts on a verified Instagram and TikTok. His Instagram bio on <a href=#>@callmeclydeo</a> even reads: "Best friend of <a href=#>@jenniferaniston</a>."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Meghan Thee Stallion</strong></a><strong> and 4oe</strong></p><p>Meghan Thee Stallion has a french bulldog named 4oe. 4oe has quite a following herself, as she made an appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" with the "Body" rapper, and has her own Instagram (<a href=#>@frenchie4oe</a>).</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff </strong></a><strong>and Izzy</strong></p><p>Hilary Duff is not only a mom, but also a dog mom.

She has two dogs, Elvis and Ethel. The eldest, Elvis celebrated his birthday earlier this year and "The Pretty Little Liars" star put both her pups in some party hats. In her caption, she thanks Elvis for being her best friend for the last 6 years, a comic contrast since Elvis and Ethel donâ€™t seem amused by their hats.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>12. </strong><a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a><strong> and Porky Basquiat</strong></p><p>The most creative name giver goes to Sophie Turner.

However, fans are most familiar with Pablo the bulldog because of his beginning moments with the family. When Pablo was first introduced to the family, everyone pronounced his name differently, and Legend refused the name "Paul." Donâ€™t worry though, all of her other dogs get plenty of screen time on her Instagram.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><strong>18. </strong><a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a><strong> and Her Dogs (And So Many More)</strong></p><p>Miley Cyrus is probably the ultimate animal parent of Hollywood.
