We might have spent too much time watching Sally Rooney's gripping TV adaptation, but the idea of a Marianne makeover is becoming increasingly appealing!</p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=e-TMNaViZrmm data-wc=3><strong>READY TO SNIP: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to cut hair at home - expert advice during lockdown&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eiHmSKcW1OiO data-wc=38>Before taking the plunge, HELLO! spoke to celebrity hairdresser Ricky Walters, owner of London's <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>SALON64</a>, to get expert advice about cutting your own fringe. Follow our easy DIY guide below – if you dare… (Disclaimer – <a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Mescal </a>not included).</p><h2 class=MsoNoSpacing>Is my hair type right for a Marianne style fringe?</h2><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eTQhbDndgYBv data-wc=48>"Marianne's fringe is relatively heavy and includes a lot of hair so it's ideal for anyone with thicker hair and plenty of it. It has no blunt lines really and is relatively soft. This probably will not work for those with strong curl or movement in their hair."</p><h2 class=MsoNoSpacing>Should I cut a Marianne fringe alone at home?</h2><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eJbGxd-ceXiS data-wc=51>"This guide is easiest for those who already have a fringe and just need to trim it at home. I would recommend waiting for your hairdressers to re-open or enlisting a friend to help. That being said, if your patience is wearing thin, this is how I would go about it!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b03e66cbc2c4-salon64-london-hairdressers-z.jpg><p class=MsoNoSpacing style=text-align:center id=euTBLjZpYXE4 data-wc=10><strong>HELLO! spoke to&nbsp;celebrity hairdresser Ricky Walters, owner of London's <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>SALON64</a></strong></p><h2 class=MsoNoSpacing>How to cut a fringe like Marianne's:</h2><h3 class=MsoNoSpacing>Step 1</h3><p id=e0ru9kj21L6s data-wc=38>"Section off a triangle shape of hair at the front of your head. The point of the triangle should face towards the crown with the other two corners of the triangle spread across the width of your face.</p><p id=eVWttSwvswA1 data-wc=40>"This is essentially mapping out the shape of the fringe - Marianne's is wide and goes just past the ends of her eyebrows. Once you're happy with this, pin all the hair not being cut safely out of the way."</p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=ezNwzpj4Anb- data-wc=2><strong>FIND OUT: <a class=hm-link href=#>Who is Daisy-Edgar Jones in real life?&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h3 class=MsoNoSpacing>Step 2</h3><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eYe7418kqQuW data-wc=23>"Taking just the slither right between your eyebrows, cut the desired length by using a comb as a ruler, using very little tension.</p><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=e137gHYn7_5L data-wc=30>"I would suggest going in stages, starting longer and gradually getting shorter, continually double checking in case hair jumps up. Try and use a point cutting technique if you can."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/be9b69366d49-marianne-normal-people-hair-z.jpg><p class=MsoNoSpacing style=text-align:center id=e-JkLrscFUf9 data-wc=10><strong>Daisy Edgar-Jones' fringe is giving us serious lockdown hair inspiration&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 class=MsoNoSpacing>Step 3</h3><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=e4dVuGfWjA3q data-wc=55>"Having cut the first section to a length you are happy with, use this as a guide to cut the two sections to the left and right of it. You want these sections to be longer. Imagine you are cutting a half moon shape - this fringe is supposed to be long, heavy and choppy."</p><h3 class=MsoNoSpacing>Step 4</h3><p class=MsoNoSpacing id=eopSsy6zditJ data-wc=36>"Checking both sides are even, lift the fringe away from your forehead, directly into the air. Gently chop into the ends by half a centimetre, maximum. This will achieve the same choppy look Marianne is rocking!"</p><p id=eqJGBEHtem25 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F%2Bj2lsa29pZYF5go6npqulkaF6sbHOqaOeZZ2Wv6qtzaecZp6inruosYygrKKclWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
