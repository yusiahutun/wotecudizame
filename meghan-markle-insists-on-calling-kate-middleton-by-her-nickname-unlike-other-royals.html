However, it has since been revealed, once again, a royal book was ‘lost in translation’.</p><p>It has recently come out a Spanish book translated the words as Kate being outside in the garden, rather than out away from the home altogether with the kids.

Instead, Princess Kate is usually used.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z%2FcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55koqajnsC1v4yopWabkaG5qrrGZqKarJViuqqww6WcraeeYq%2B6eceeqWammZi4r63MnmSuppyeuKZ5zq2fnqpdp7y6rcusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
