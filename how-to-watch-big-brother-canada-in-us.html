Plus, season 12 just started, so there’s plenty of drama to catch up on.</p><p>Big Brother Canada,&nbsp;a spinoff of the Dutch reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> series <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/big-brother-winner-2023/>Big Brother</a>, premiered in 2013 on the Canadian network Slice before it moved to Global TV in season three. The show follows the same format as other versions of Big Brother, where around 15 contestants live in a house together with no communication with the outside world as they compete for a cash prize. On Big Brother Canada, that prize is $200,000 Canadian Dollars. While in the house, the contestants—who are called “Houseguests”—are filmed 24/7. Viewers used to be able to watch the contestants on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1622188/how-to-watch-big-brother-live-feeds/>live feeds</a>, but in February 2024, it was announced that live feeds would not be returning for season 12. “Digital Dailies,” which launched in season 11, are back this season. Fans can see uncut footage from the house on a weekly basis. These videos are available to watch on the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.bigbrothercanada.ca/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">show’s website</a>. The contestants compete in challenges for power and safety as they vote out each other one by one until two Houseguests remain. The eliminated Houseguests, who form a jury, vote between the two finalists for the winner of that <a rel=noopener href=#>Big Brother</a> season.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Mike’s Bloggity Blog</a> in 2013, Big Brother Canada host Arisa Cox revealed what the show often looks for in contestants they want to cast. “We saw such diverse personalities in the house, I don’t think you should try to be like anyone else. Just be yourself. I spoke with the casting director who does a lot of the U.S shows and she said it was so refreshing that in Canada not everyone is trying to be an actor,” she said. “Our people have actual jobs and just love the game. So I think they want to see people more like that, a dentist, a firefighter. I think that’s what they want.</p><p>Season 12 of Big Brother Canada kicked off on March 5, 2024 and features 14 Houseguests. Twelve are brand-new to the show, while the remaining two have appeared on the show before. This pair of “all-stars” are sure spice things up in the house. Plus, you’ll notice the house just got an upgrade!</p><p>So how can Americans <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>watch Big Brother Canada in the US</a>?
