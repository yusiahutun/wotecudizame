Luckily, overwater bungalows are becoming more popular around the world and can be found at resorts even close by in Europe.</p><p>One hotel in nearby Crete has been described as "a Maldives experience in the Mediterranean sea – and we can see why thanks to its luxurious bungalows which sit over the pool at a fraction of the cost of jetting off to the atolls of the Maldives.</p><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>READ MORE: Breathtaking European 'Maldives' boast 32C weather in March, 50p pints and £5.50 rooms</a></b></p><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>READ MORE: Sun-soaked beach is 'one of Europe's most beautiful' with £7.50pp rooms and £22 flights</b></a></p><p>Thankfully, Crete is only a few hours away by plane from the UK – and flights cost <a href=# rel=nofollow>from a tiny £44 for a return</a> – so travel will also be less stressful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27551808.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Image.jpg><p>So, those looking to sink into blue waters, relax in the sunshine and swim up to their room can finally afford to do so. The bungalows are decorated in wood and glass with tropical scenery and a private deck for each villa. That way you can enjoy privacy and your own space to chow down of Lay's crisps and a cold Fanta, or beer, after a mid-afternoon swim.</p><p>Crete is pretty good value for Brits too – if you don't opt for all all-inclusive option you can buy a pint for as cheaply as £2.54, according to PintPrice. However, we're pretty sure you won't want to leave your hotel if you opt for an overwater bungalow.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32133246><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="Gorgeous sun-soaked island has £1.50 beers and Below Deck filming locations" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32133246><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32133768.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Grand-Anse-Bay-Grenada.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32133768.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Grand-Anse-Bay-Grenada.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32133246>Gorgeous sun-soaked island has £1.50 beers and Below Deck filming locations</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32114456><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Tenerife's 'hidden beach' has waterfall and amazing sands - but no signposts to find it" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32114456><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32114517.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_MAINSOCIAL.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32114456>Tenerife's 'hidden beach' has waterfall and amazing sands - but no signposts to find it</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Stella Island Luxury Resort & Spa</a> in Greece, looks just as amazing as the Maldives and for a lot less money – which is important during the current financial crisis. he 225-room adults only hotel boasts overwater bungalows, which looks like the ones you’d see in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Guests can sunbathe beside a giant pool, on the stylish decks or at a private beach on Crete’s northern coast.

We had a swim up room, which was ideal because we didn't have to wake up early to get the sun beds and a waitress would take the order for your drinks and bring them over. The beds were comfy and the shower was really powerful.</p><p>"Definitely a MUST to go all inclusive as this covers all your food and drink all night for room service the Kimata buffet in the evening outstanding! Overall the hotel is absolutely beautiful and the architecture was unbelievable, would definitely come back here."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29096218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Crystal-clear-waters-of-Ksamil-Albanian-rivira-Albania.jpg><p>Another added: "This was our second visit to Stella Island. After visiting last year, we absolutely had to return. The entire resort is stunning, even better than it looks on social media. It is incredibly peaceful and ideal for a relaxing break. The rooms are gorgeous. We chose a luxury swim up room ."</p><p>While a third person commented: "Maldives meets Crete! The resort itself is beautiful. No detail was spared when building this place."</p><p>If the cost of a stay at Stella Islands is just that bit too high for you then there are other options within Europe. Ksamil in Albania boasts sparkling blue sea and white sand beaches – and has been dubbed a "Maldives-style" paradise by fans. You can stay in the stunning Albanian Riviera incredibly cheaply <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>with rooms from £5.50pp per night.</a></p><p><b>*All prices were correct at the time of publication but are subject to change and adjustment at any time.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6tqZqulaF6r7HWrGagqpWauG60zq2cpWWSpK60wNJmpq%2BdoqyutbHRZpmuppeWubDD0mZpcG1lZYZ1gg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
