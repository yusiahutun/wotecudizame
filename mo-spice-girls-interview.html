The 29-year-old indie-pop star recalled dressing up (she was always Sporty Spice) and performing songs by the girl band with her friends. "It was the biggest thing," the Danish singer, born Karen Marie Ørsted, told BAZAAR.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Traces of her fandom continued to show even after she'd started her own music career. In 2014, she recorded a somber cover of Spice Girls' <a href=# data-href=https://open.spotify.com/album/5AyQKsPpZ0WK6shtBDZGOw data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://open.spotify.com/album/5AyQKsPpZ0WK6shtBDZGOw data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Say You&#39;ll Be There"' class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">"Say You'll Be There"</a> and used a throwback photo of her friends dressed up as the group for her album art. Now the tables have turned; she has plenty of diehard fans of her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">MØ is probably best known for her feature on "Lean On" with Major Lazer and DJ Snake, which became the <a href=# data-href=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6760813/major-lazer-lean-on-spotify-most-streamed-song-all-time data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6760813/major-lazer-lean-on-spotify-most-streamed-song-all-time data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="most-streamed song ever" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">most-streamed song ever</a> in 2015. With that summer hit, she proved her raspy voice is the perfect match for dance-pop crossovers. She then reunited with Major Lazer for "Cold Water" featuring Justin Bieber in 2016, and teamed up with Snakehips on "Don't Leave" early this year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But she also has her own solo work to be proud of, namely, her <a href=# data-href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/when-i-was-young-ep/id1292331475 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/when-i-was-young-ep/id1292331475 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="When I Was Young EP" data-vars-ga-product-id=b26f7b80-a9b4-44f9-935e-05ba81ef6b14 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-product-url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/when-i-was-young-ep/id1292331475 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fwhen-i-was-young-ep%2Fid1292331475" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1434b964-b1e6-42db-a32f-bf31d0d9adc7 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">When I Was Young EP</a>, released yesterday. "These years have been a learning process about what's important, and that’s what this EP reflects," she says in a statement. The six-track body of work is MØ's first since her 2014 debut album, No Mythologies To Follow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, MØ talks to BAZAAR.com about her childhood obsession, what girl power means to her, and how she makes music.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">As a child, MØ and her school friends would form mini Spice Girls cover bands to perform for the neighborhood.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I remember for all the years Spice Girls were around, my class and all the girls in my neighborhood would form little groups, where they would rehearse doing playback of the Spice Girls and dress up like them. It was the biggest thing. Seriously, I'm not kidding. Every break you had in school, you would be discussing like, ‘Oh, so who has like some leopard clothes that Scary Spice can wear?’ Like, ‘Who has this?’ And, ‘How can we get that?’ ‘My mom can sew, like let's go and buy this.’ There was always so much girl drama about it, because everybody wanted to be Emma, and people would get in fights and people would get kicked out of the groups and it'd be a big mess—but it was so much fun.”</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">She gravitated to Sporty Spice as a girl. Coincidentally, she ended up dressing like her as an adult, thanks to athleisure.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She's my vibe. She always was my vibe, that kind of energy, and her way of dressing. We're all different, and she was the one that I could connect to the most.”</p><img alt="Performance, Arm, Physical fitness, Shoulder, Human body, Muscle, Performing arts, Dancer, Event, Abdomen, " title="Performance, Arm, Physical fitness, Shoulder, Human body, Muscle, Performing arts, Dancer, Event, Abdomen, " width=1888 height=2832 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-mo-476056958-1509122316.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Performing at Governors Ball in 2015.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">She learned a lot about girl power from major girl groups. (One of her many tattoos is a balaclava, which she got in Russia in honor of Pussy Riot when its band members were in jail.)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think actually the Spice Girls did influence me a lot growing up, because it was this whole thing about, ‘F*ck guys, it's all about friendship. It’s about being powerful and having fun.’ All these things, as a young girl, that's something you really want to connect with and you can relate so much because, again, I was seven, I didn't f*ckin' care about boys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We all got so close to each other through this obsession of Spice Girls and through this worshiping of them. In a way, all of the things they stand for, they brought that to us physically, in a way. That was wonderful, that was awesome.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"F*ck guys, it's all about friendship. It’s about being powerful and having fun."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When I became a teenager I learned about the whole riot girl movement and grungy girl bands, and I got super into that, which is a totally different genre and political scene. I think it's something that I've always been drawn to. It was super cool, strong female bands. What's not to f*cking love?”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Like the Spice Girls, MØ also sings about the importance of female friendships in her recent single, “Nights With You,” which was dedicated to her best friend instead of a love interest.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When I was writing the lyrics for it, I was just thinking about my best and oldest friend. She's from Denmark, and we've been friends since kindergarten. I was just like, ‘F*ck, I've never written a song to her.’ In a way, it's weird 'cause she's my human; she's my f*cking best friend. I just remember it was such a pleasant experience, just sitting, writing a song for her and thinking about what I would actually say to her if I were to make an anthem for her.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Her songwriting process changed when she worked on "Lean On."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Ever since ‘Lean On,’ even a little bit before, I've been writing in very different ways. Sometimes I'll get a beat sent over and I'll write to that, sometimes I’m in a session, sometimes I’m alone with a producer, or with a couple of writers and a couple of producers. Sometimes I just sit down and write everything on a piano. Sometimes I'll write a scratch in my Logic Pro [music production program]. It just depends on the situation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A lot of the songs that I do come from just sitting in a hotel room somewhere, and then gleaning an idea and starting something, and then I take it from there. Sometimes it's lyrics, as well. Especially on an airplane, I always get so many ideas for lyrics for some reason, so I write all that shit down and then sometimes that's where it starts. Seriously, with some of the best songs I think I've written, the first ideas have always been written so quickly, like within an hour in a strange place, randomly.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">In addition to changing her creative approach, “Lean On” opened doors to working with more EDM acts and big DJs—but she still wants to ensure she keeps her unique sound.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think that whole thing kind of started because of ‘Lean On.’ I mean, I was a big fan of Major Lazer for many years, even way before. I never saw myself as an EDM act, at all. To be honest, I wasn't even sure that Major Lazer was an EDM act. I didn't really know what EDM was. I guess it has changed a lot now, but after ‘Lean On,’ I was kind of in that world, so I've been working a bit with people like that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I really want to also make a sound of my own. I used to be in a punk band. I love instruments. I want to mix real instruments with something that, of course, fits in with the time and with pop music, but I think it's important to try to strive to make something that's original and unique, and also push the borders. Of course, I always want as many people as possible to listen to it. Make it adaptable but also f*ck up things, you know? You need that, otherwise it's boring.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"In an ocean of opportunities, it's so easy to get lost"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">She's still dealing with her sudden rise to fame, but the journey is helping her figure out her priorities.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When I started out I was this indie artist, coming from a punk band and getting a bit more mainstream, but still super indie. That was great. I was on a journey. The landscape just changed a lot because all of a sudden a lot of doors were open, a lot of people wanted to work with me. I always say in an ocean of opportunities it's so easy to get lost because you gotta be really strong in your core. Like, what do I want to do? What kind of artist do I want to be? What career do I want? Especially coming from a super indie background, to suddenly have people look at you and think, "Oh, you can be a big pop star," that's such a change. So it's been taking me a while to come back to the core of what I really want to do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It's been really fun, and I enjoy putting out music and experimenting, even out in the open. I think that's great. Then slowly, you're gonna find your thing. I feel like I'm more and more figuring that out now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stream MØ's When I Was Young EP below:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
