Eminem threw shade at Diddy's Revolt media company and when the company threw shade back at him, he quickly stepped up and agreed with everything they said.
&#34;I agree with Revolt,&#34; the rapper said after lyrics he'd written were leaked that were critical of the company. &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Originally written for Conway the Machine's 2019 hit "Bang," Eminem changed the lyrics for the final cut.</p><p>While he was "heated" when he wrote them, Em said he has no issues with the company now and, in fact, would "welcome the opportunity to work with them on some positive things and turn this in a different direction."</p><p>In the scrapped verse, Eminem raps, "Yeah, shout to Puffy Combs, but f--k REVOLT / Y'all are like a f--ked up remote / Now I get it why our button's broke / 'Cause you pressing the heat but do nothing though / Especially when it comes to punch this throne."</p><p>Revolt is a black-owned media company founded by Diddy in 2013 that houses a film operation as well as a music-focused television network.

"It is not OK."</p><p>The company further called into question how the lyrics got leaked, and said that it could have done damage to the work they're trying to do. "What Em's 'mess' could’ve done -- is it could've harmed our business," Revolt said. "Fortunately, it was a minor social media distraction, but the potential implications should not be OK."</p><p>Now that Eminem has effectively agreed with the company and said that he not only had no control over the leak, but no intention of that verse ever going public, it remains to be seen how or if Revolt will have anything further to say on the matter.</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
