Chad Gilbert joined his first band, Shai Hulud, at the age of 14, and for the last two decades, he has been the lead guitarist, background vocalist, and composer of the rock band New Found Glory.&nbsp;</p><p>But as successful as he became in his career, he never seemed to be able to hold together on the marriage front. Here is everything you need to know about Chad Gilbert’s Relationship with Sherri DuPree and Hayley Williams</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chad Gilbert’s Bio</strong></h2><p>The lead guitarist of New Found Glory was born on March 9, 1981, as Chad Gilbert in Coral Springs, Florida. He attended the J.P. Taravella High School. Gilbert grew up with rock and country music of the 50s and 60s when his parents were familiar with the genre. He lived in Los Angeles for most of his adult life (14 years) before moving to Franklin, Nashville as a full-time employee.</p><p>Since his teenage years, Chad Gilbert has led a clean lifestyle, partly inspired by listening to H2O songs. In 2010, however, he had some health problems that required surgical intervention. Half of his thyroid gland was removed after the discovery of some suspicious cells. The surgery was a success and no cancer cell was found.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Benzino Bio, Wife, Daughter, Son, Age, Net Worth, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>He was recruited as a vocalist by the then-newly formed hardcore punk band Shai Hulud and sang with them from 1995 to 1997. The band recorded a three-part extended play (EP) entitled A Profound Hatred Of Man (1997) but became known for their first full-length piece Hearts Once Nourished with Hope and Compassion, which was released later that year. He did, however, join his mother’s band on tour in 2004 and then again in 2012 to accompany and produce their fourth studio album, Reach Beyond the Sun (2013).</p><p>Shortly after leaving, he joined three friends, Jordan Pundik (lead vocals), Ian Grushka (bass), and Steve Klein (guitar) to form the rock band New Found Glory. As part of the quintet, Gilbert plays the lead guitarist, sings the backing vocals, and composes music. Cyrus Bolooki joined the band in 1997 to replace the provisional drummer, Joe Marino, and Klein left in 2013.</p><p>The band is known for its energetic live performances and is considered by music critics to be one of the most important pioneers of the pop-punk genre. They have released nine studio albums, one live album, two EPs, and three cover albums.</p><p>In addition, Gilbert was the lead singer for the now-abandoned side project of the band, their regularly released hardcore punk band International Superheroes of Hardcore. They recorded about sixteen songs, all of which are typically humorous.</p><p>Their solo album entitled Takin’ it Ova! (2008) was included in the New Found Glory EP Tip of the Iceberg and is available separately on 12? vinyl. Also in 2008, on November 25, they released an EP, HPxHC.</p><p>Chad Gilbert has a solo project called What’s Eating Gilbert, for which he started writing songs in 2009 and is also known as a record producer on several projects. Despite his busy schedule at New Found Glory, he found time to release solo music online for free, including several demos and 7? vinyl records.</p><p>In 2010 he released three EPPs, the Cheap Shots EP (2012), a split single with the band Octaves in 2013, and the Come On Let’s Go EP in 2014. What’s Eating Gilbert’s debut album That New Sound You’re Looking For was released in 2015 on Hopeless Records.</p><p>As a producer, Chad Gilbert produced the albums Nothing to Prove (2008) and Use Your Voice (2015) by H2O, A Day to Remember, including Homesick (2009), What Separates Me from You (2010), and Common Courtesy (2013), and All I Have to Offer Is My Confusion (2009) by Fireworks.</p><p>He also wrote the song Hit or Miss for American Pie 2. In 2018 he began his latest project, an annual breakfast music festival called BreakFEST, which debuted at The Factory at Franklin’s Liberty Hall on June 24.</p><p>Although he has been in the industry for over two decades, Gilbert has maintained his passion and drive by staying focused, staying true to his roots, and making professional and creative decisions that always benefit his audiences.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Lily Tomlin, Is She Gay, Who is the Wife – Jane Wagner and Her Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chad Gilbert’s </strong><strong>Relationship </strong><strong>Haylee Williams</strong></h2><p>The lead guitarist of New Found Glory began dating Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams in 2008. Williams joined the NFG in 2010 (bass) and 2014 (vocals) as a touring guest and also inspired their song, Vicious Love.</p><p>Six years after starting their relationship, they got engaged in December 2014 and less than two years later they decided to become man and wife. The rock star’s wedding was celebrated on February 20, 2016. Although they enjoyed a long and sweet date, it seems that marriage has given them the rest. They announced their separation on July 1, 2017, after almost a decade together, although they remain close friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chad Gilbert’s </strong><strong>Relationship with Sherri DuPree</strong></h2><p>Sherri DuPree is the first known partner of Gilbert. She was born on December 3, 1983, and is also a musician and singer/songwriter. Like Chad, she belongs to a band called Eisley, which she founded with her siblings in 1997, and is known as one of her main singers and songwriters. She is also a visual artist.</p><p>The duo married on February 17, 2007, but the union did not last long and was soon dissolved. After her divorce, Sherri remarried in July 2009 with a fellow musician, Max Bemis, while Chad moved on with Hayley Williams. DuPree and Bemis are parents of three children, two girls, Lucy Jean and Coraline Mae, and one son, Charles Hanley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKmtw2aeoqSSmr%2B1v4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW6%2Fx56pq6FdmcKxvsSeZJqmlGK1osXLnrBmr5mhuaqtzKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
