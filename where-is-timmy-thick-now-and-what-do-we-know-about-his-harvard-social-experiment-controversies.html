Widespread speculation suggests that his real name is Justin, but the sensation in social media has officially confirmed nothing.</p><p>According to the little evidence he has provided since he entered the spotlight, Timmy had a difficult time growing up, precisely because of the physical and verbal harassment he had to endure from people. The bullying was a consequence of his body, which is more female than male.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kristina Pimenova Parents, Wiki, Family, Net Worth, Age, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Did He Become Popular?</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Timmy Thick met a man from New Jersey.
