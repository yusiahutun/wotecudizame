Of course, the process of making both isn’t nearly as simple as adding a coagulant to the respective milks. Both are further processed - almost always by pressing to rid them of excess liquid, and sometimes, adding ingredients to change the flavour, followed by (again, sometimes) ageing. Wait, flavoured and aged tofu? Yes, but we’ll get to that in a minute.</p><h3 class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 article-content-item--header t--body_title c--black" data-v-80a87d76>How tofu is made</h3><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>Tofu is the name and spelling used most often for bean curd, but it is actually the Japanese word for a Chinese invention - doufu. There are many theories and legends about how bean curd first came into being, but it’s generally accepted that it’s been eaten in China for more than 2,000 years, followed by Japan then other parts of Asia.</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>It’s made with soybeans, water and coagulant, and its producers and fans would argue that the quality of each is important. Artisinal producers insist on water from mountain streams, organic, non-GMO soy beans, and a precise amount of coagulants, which are sometimes used in combination and can range from ordinary Epsom salts (rarely used commercially) to food-grade calcium sulphate (gypsum) or magnesium chloride (nigari).</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>To make bean curd, soybeans are soaked, pureed, then simmered to rid them of their raw taste and make them digestible. The mixture is strained to remove the solids, heated again and the coagulant is stirred in. The curdled milk is strained a second time (to remove the watery whey) then the curds are pressed under weights to make them cohesive. How long the curds are pressed determines whether it’s soft, medium or firm.</p><h3 class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 article-content-item--header t--body_title c--black" data-v-80a87d76>Is it good for you?</h3><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>It depends on what you’re looking for. It’s been touted as the world’s healthiest food, but as with everything, it should be eaten in moderation - you couldn’t survive solely on tofu. It’s a low-fat, high protein, cholesterol-free ingredient with plenty of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids. It’s great for vegetarians as a meat- or seafood-substitute (although they should make sure their diet includes fat, which is essential for health). Consumption of tofu is believed (but not conclusively proven) to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, lower cholesterol, and help women going through menopause.&nbsp;</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>There are many types of bean curd products, and they have different uses. In well-stocked supermarkets, you’ll find at least three types of fresh bean curd.</p><figure class="content-item-image pos--relative" data-v-80a87d76></figure><p>Soft bean curd (sometimes called silken tofu)</p><p>The softest bean curd you’ll find in traditional block form, although it’s also sold in tubes. It takes great skill to cut soft bean curd into thin slices without them falling apart; ditto with cooking it without it losing its shape.

In Hong Kong, it’s usually eaten with a ginger-flavoured syrup, or sprinkled with Chinese brown sugar. You can sometimes find this in supermarkets, where it’s sold in small plastic tubs, but the best is made at tofu shops.</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76><strong data-v-80a87d76>Fu yu and naam yu</strong></p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>Fu yu (which is off white) and naam yu (reddish in colour) are often called Chinese cheese, although they don’t contain dairy products. They’re made by putting fresh bean curd in rice wine brine and ageing it, which makes it denser and creamier. Usually sold in jars, it’s used as a flavouring, instead of a main ingredient in dishes.</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76><strong data-v-80a87d76>Stinky tofu</strong></p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>You won’t find stinky tofu in supermarkets; instead, it’s sold as street food and restaurants, usually fried and served with chilli sauce, but sometimes it is simmered in soups or stews.

The skin is lifted off, and can be used immediately (when it’s very soft) or dried (which needs to be hydrated, and has a chewier texture). The dried form is sold in bags in supermarkets.</p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76><strong data-v-80a87d76>Tempeh</strong></p><p class="article-content-item pos--relative width--100p level--0 flex layout--xs sm8 offset-sm2 t--body c--black" data-v-80a87d76>Like bean curd skin, tempeh isn’t a bean curd product, although it is made of soybeans, but it belongs in this article because it, too, is a good plant-based protein alternative to meat. Tempeh has a much rougher texture than bean curd, because the hulled soybeans are left whole before being fermented with an edible mould, then shaped into firm cakes. When you slice open a tempeh cake, you can see the soybeans suspended in the white mould. It has a stronger taste&nbsp;than most types of tofu, and is delicious mixed with sambal or another assertively seasoned sauce.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC7yqKloGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxoaGmDdX2OraafrV2axbG4wKKlnpxdnby4ecitqmalkZmybq3NnWSrnZOevaa%2FjK6qnmWkpLO2</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
