But his hosts perhaps got more than they bargained for when it sounded like the tactician popped off in quite the literal sense.</p><p>While airing out Michael Beale over <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Rangers</a>' recent run of poor form and defeat at home in the Old Firm, Lennon had a very noticeable pause while pursing his lips in concentration. The microphone then picked up something that sounded unmistakeably fart-like before he cracked on with the job at hand.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Roy Keane breaks cover after Arsenal fan allegedly attacked him 'breaking his own nose'</b></a></p><p>"He need to find, first of all, the [pause and parp] best formation that suits this squad of players," said the 40-cap former Northern Ireland international while very much skipping a beat. "And he should know, Peter, because he's brought these players in himself."</p><p>No-one else in the studio reacted in real time to the sound of trumpets in the air, and the segment carried on like business as usual. Either the sound failed to reach the ears of his hosts at the time, or PLZ is home to some extremely professional talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30867420.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS309956539.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30867422.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS309956537.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30865218><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="How Jadon Sancho's Man Utd team-mates feel about star after Erik ten Hag row" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30865218><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30865420.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Real-Madrid-v-Manchester-United-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30865420.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Real-Madrid-v-Manchester-United-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30865218>How Jadon Sancho's Man Utd team-mates feel about star after Erik ten Hag row</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30740994><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Virgin Media price cut on movies and sport bundle as customers get £150 off bill" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30740994><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28458120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Economy-Illustration.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30740994>Virgin Media price cut on movies and sport bundle as customers get £150 off bill</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>The clip was shared far and wide as some fans agreed it was a case of 'better out than in'.
