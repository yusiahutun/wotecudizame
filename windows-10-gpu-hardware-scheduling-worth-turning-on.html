This feature was included by Microsoft in the May 2020 update, and since then, many gamers have given it a try to see if it helps them or not. However, your computer’s GPU might not support it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you want to know more about GPU hardware scheduling, keep reading as we discuss how it works, system requirements, and how you can turn it on.</p><h2 id=how-does-gpu-hardware-scheduling-work>How Does GPU Hardware Scheduling Work?</h2><p>Usually, the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) GPU scheduler takes care of managing multiple processes that submit tasks to the GPU. While the GPU is responsible for rendering, the CPU is responsible for planning and sending those tasks to the GPU. To make the process more efficient, the CPU will submit commands in batches, instead of one at a time.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This technique is called frame buffering, and it increases performance by producing a better frame rate. However, this process comes at a cost since it also increases input latency. As such, when you press a button, there will be no effect until the CPU submits the new batch to the GPU.</p><p>The hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling feature takes some of the high-priority tasks that your CPU usually manages and passes them to a dedicated GPU-based scheduling processor. Theoretically, this should <a href=#>take some load off the CPU</a> and reduce the input lag.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=should-you-enable-gpu-hardware-scheduling>Should You Enable GPU Hardware Scheduling?</h2><p>If your computer has a low or mid-tier CPU, the GPU hardware scheduling feature might be worth turning on. Especially if your CPU reaches 100% load in certain games.</p><p>If the feature is not available for you, there are a couple of ways you can improve your computer performance without upgrading. For example, you can disable frame buffering either via in-game options or through the GPU driver control panel. This should allow you to <a href=#>keep playing games with great visuals on your aging PC</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>In the end, the decision is yours. If you decide to test it with multiple games and don’t see any changes, don’t be surprised. According to Microsoft, users shouldn’t notice any major differences in-game. However, you may notice some positive changes when <a href=#>checking your CPU’s temperature</a> and load..</p><h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-enable-gpu-hardware-scheduling>What Do You Need to Enable GPU Hardware Scheduling?</h2><p>Because GPU Hardware Scheduling became available in 2020, you need a pretty new PC to use this feature. You need to be running Windows 10 2004 or a newer version and have a supported GPU installed on your PC.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>At the time of writing, only NVidia GPUs support hardware scheduling. Both AMD and Intel are working on support for this feature in a future update, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p>Once you're sure you have a compatible GPU, double-check that it uses the latest drivers. If your computer ticks all the boxes, it's time to enable the GPU hardware scheduling feature in Windows 10.</p><h2 id=how-to-turn-on-hardware-scheduling-via-windows-settings>How to Turn On Hardware Scheduling Via Windows Settings</h2><p>Follow these steps to turn on GPU hardware scheduling:</p><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, then head to <strong>Settings > System</strong>.</li><li>From the left-hand menu, select <strong>Display</strong>.</li><li>Below <strong>Multiple Displays</strong>, click <strong>Graphics settings</strong>.</li><li>Turn on the toggle for <strong>Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/settings-gpu-1.jpg><h2 id=how-to-turn-on-hardware-scheduling-using-the-registry-editor>How to Turn On Hardware Scheduling Using the Registry Editor</h2><p>If you can’t find the option within <strong>Settings</strong>, you need to enable it from <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.
