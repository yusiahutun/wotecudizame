The flight was leaving the Bahamas’ Abaco Islands, the location of the music video shoot for Rock The Boat.</p><p>Filming ended unexpectedly early, so the singer and her team her eager to return to the US as soon as possible. Nine passengers – including Aaliyah – boarded a Cessna 402 plane at 6:50 pm at Marsh Harbour Airport. The aircraft was smaller than the Cessna 404 they arrived in, but the 402 was large enough to accommodate all staff and equipment.</p><p>The plane crashed and burst into flames moments after takeoff, killing the singer and eight others: pilot Luis Morales III, makeup artist Christopher Maldonado, hairstylist Eric Forman, security guard Scott Gallon, friend Keith Wallace, Anthony Dodd, Blackground Records employees Douglas Kratz and Gina Smith.</p><p>An Abaco Air Ltd employee who worked at Marsh Harbour Airport <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> CNN baggage handlers and the pilot reported the plane as overloaded. However, the passengers “insisted on taking everything with them.” Investigators believe the aircraft was 700lbs overloaded.</p><p>Pathologist Giovander Raju, who performed autopsies on Aaliyah and the eight other victims, confirmed the actress died of severe burns and a blow to the head. He later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a> at the 2003 coroner’s inquest the 22-year-old “suffered generally from a weak heart.”</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said Pilot Morales was not authorized to fly the plane. The aircraft was operated by Blackhawk Airways International, who had authorized extremely limited use of Cessna 402. The authorized person was not flying the plane at the time of the incident. Questions about the pilot arose after it was discovered he faced a drug charge 12 days before the crash, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> The New York Times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-119974698-689x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aaliyah-s-marriage-to-r-kelly-was-under-wraps-for-years>Aaliyah’s marriage to R Kelly was under wraps for years</h2><p>Aside from her musical talent, the Romeo Must Die actress’ love life was consistently in the tabloid news, specifically her close relationship with mentor R Kelly. Industry whispers suspected the pair, who had a 12-year age difference, had a physical relationship but they both continuously denied rumors.</p><p>It was later revealed that then-15-year-old Aaliyah entered an illegal marriage with Kelly in August 1994, when he was 27. The marriage license falsified her age as 18. Her parents reportedly annulled the marriage in February 1995.</p><p>In the Lifetime docuseries, Surviving R Kelly, the rapper’s friend and former security, Gem Pratt, alleged Aaliyah’s family agreed to sign an NDA. They supposedly promised to not press charges if Kelly sold the family the rights to his first three albums.</p><p>For the next six years, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> distanced herself from her former mentor and embraced a new sound with Timbaland. But she was never able to rid herself of the infamous union.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcK3ApaCymZioera606KknqSpYrGmrdOhZJ%2BnnKG8uLHDZpifrJWnerG1y6irZq%2BRqHq2usCuq6Gnop7HprCMraZmnpyuerG4wKecaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
