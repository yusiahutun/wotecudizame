Will broke the news to Jabari that got the part via Zoom call the video of which uploaded on Peacock’s YouTube channel has been viewed over 255k times.</p><p>This Jabari Banks Bio covers details on the young actor’s rumor of being gay, his father, information on his girlfriend/partner, his net worth, and his height.</p><h3><strong>Is Jabari Banks Gay?</strong></h3><p>Jabari Bank hasn’t spoken much about his sexuality. It remains unclear if he is gay or straight or bi-sexual. The young actor’s dating life is not discussed anywhere and he is yet to open up about it. So, labeling him gay or straight wouldn’t be appropriate until he confirms it.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Jabari Banks Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Fans of “Will” from “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” as well as the new fans of Jabari Banks would love to know about the actor’s dating life. He is a handsome young adult, up-and-coming who hit a bulls-eye on his very first major project by landing the part. So, his relationship status is a matter of interest for many.</p><p>But, like most young actors, Jabari also prefers to keep his dating life away from the public eye, at least for now. He demonstrated minimum involvement on social media so there is nothing there. He hasn’t been interviewed much so there has been no opportunity to share details related to love life.</p><p>Taking all of that into consideration, we would like to conclude that Jabari Banks doesn’t have a girlfriend and is single at the moment. If he is maintaining a secret relationship, he will open up about it when he is ready.</p><h3><strong>Jabari Banks Father</strong></h3><p>In the Zoom call with Will Smith, Jabari Banks revealed that it was his father who sent him an article and told him to go audition for the show. He, then, replied that the auditions don’t work that way. Nevertheless, Jabari prepared and he gave his best and his agent was able to book him a role which he didn’t know was of “Will.”</p><p>Besides that, most of his family has stayed out of public attention.</p><h3><strong>Jabari Banks Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Jabari Banks’s net worth is under $150 thousand.</p><p>Justin Luján, program director for acting at the University of the Arts, revealed to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Jabari is “jack of all trades.” He added further, “He sings, he dances, he acts, he raps, and he plays basketball, which is what got him this role. And in that way, he’s like Will Smith.”</p><p>Yes, Jabari Banks who is an art graduate is playing the role of ‘Will’ in the Peacock’s reboot of the ’90s smash-hit show “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” The original ‘Fresh Prince’ Will Smith himself delivered the news to Jabari via video chat. The young actor promised Will that he was “so ready” for the role.</p><p>Will congratulated Jabari saying, “From the deepest parts of my heart, I want to say congratulations to you. You have the role of Will on Bel-Air.”</p><p>Currently, Jabari signed to Frontline Management and The Kohner Agency. His longtime friend Craig Dorfman manages him according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. They met each other while teaching a class at the University of the Arts in 2019. They stumbled upon each other again when he directed the L.A. showcase in 2020.</p><p>Jabari’s manager made a prophecy to Justin Luján that Jabari was going to be a star. He reflected that Jabari had the personality and swagger and dubbed him the next “Will Smith.” Morgan Cooper is the director/co-writer/executive producer of the show.</p><p>According to Deadline, Bel-Air received a two-season order in September 2020. The show is a product of Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith’s Westbrook Studios and Universal Television. “Bel-Air” will film in both Philadelphia and California.</p><p>Jabari the new “Fresh Prince” is “fresh” in every sense of the word. He is new and only has one credit on his <a href=#>IMDB page</a>.</p><h3><strong>How Tall Is Jabari Banks?</strong></h3><p>With a lean-body type, baby-face, Jabari Banks stands tall at the height of under 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4>How Old Is Jabari Banks?</h4></li></ul><p>Jabari Banks is 23 years old as of 2021.</p><ul><li><h4>Where Was Jabari Banks Born?</h4></li></ul><p>Jabari Banks is a native of Atlanta.
