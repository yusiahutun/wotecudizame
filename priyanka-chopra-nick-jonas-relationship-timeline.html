So that song is my favorite.” Jonas tweeted about the single, which was released a year after his two-year relationship with fashion influencer Olivia Culpo, writing: “The first song you’re gonna hear tomorrow night is about how I literally can’t open up and be vulnerable with someone.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 2016</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to mutual friend Graham Rogers, who starred alongside Chopra in Quantico and Jonas in the indie thriller Careful What You Wish For, they started communicating. Jonas made the first move via Twitter direct message, and Chopra got the ball rolling with a series of texts that Jonas defined as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“friendly with an eye toward fliration.”</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gisela Schober/Getty Images</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>February 2017</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn’t until the Vanity Fair Oscar Party when the two finally met. The Jumanji actor recounts his courageously public gesture to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>, “I put my drink down, get on one knee and I say, ‘You’re real. Where have you been all my life?’ Like, loud.” A seemingly Hollywood Cinderella story, Chopra, who was set to catch a flight to India that night, told Jonas she had five minutes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2017</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just a week before making their debut on the Met Gala red carpet, Jonas and Chopra met for drinks at The Carlyle. Chopra invited Jonas to her apartment to meet her mother — a bold move for two people claiming to be “just friends” at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair stunned on the red carpet, looking longingly into each other’s eyes, their arms securely placed on each other’s backs. Chopra wore a custom Ralph Lauren trench gown with an exaggerated popped collar and dramatic 20-foot train that draped over the museum staircase. Jonas watched in admiration while donning a Ralph Lauren geometric printed suit.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jackson Lee/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days following the event, Chopra made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where she skirted a direct answer to host Jimmy Kimmel’s dating inquiries. Chopra coyly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>responded</a>, “We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chopra and Jonas didn’t see each other for a year until their red carpet bump-in at the 2018 Met gala. It appeared that even with a full year apart, the two hadn’t missed a beat. Later that month, Jonas and Chopra attended a live performance of Beauty and the Beast and a Dodgers game the following night. Nick called his mother the next morning, proclaiming that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he was going to marry Chopra</a> just after having their third date.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>June 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chopra and Jonas’s relationship status was promptly validated by a handful of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flirtatious Instagram comments</a>, captions and posts. Amid dinner date sightings in West Hollywood and hand-holding in Brazil, speculation quickly turned into confirmation. And so the whirlwind of romance began. Chopra met Jonas’ parents at a family wedding, then, shortly after, Jonas met Chopra’s family in India.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>July 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Chopra’s birthday celebration trip in Crete, Greece, Jonas popped the question. “I got down on one knee, again, and I said ‘Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?’” The Voice judge recalls to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>, “No joke — she took about 45 seconds. I said ‘I’m going to put this ring on your finger now unless you have any objections.’”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>August 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A month after their proposal, the couple journeyed to India for an engagement ceremony. “[A roka ceremony symbolizes] confirmation from both sides of the family that they approve of the engagement. We both left that ceremony full of joy,” Jonas <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared</a> on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. “We had this beautiful ceremony and we felt so connected and our families all met and it was spiritual, and then we put it on Instagram and we were like, ‘Oh my God, it’s official.’”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>October 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to his proposal, Jonas shut down the London Tiffany & Co store to shop for his then-soon-to-be-wife’s ring. Chopra then held a Breakfast at Tiffany’s-themed bridal shower at the Blue Box Café in NYC. The Baywatch actress graced a strapless feathered Marchesa midi dress.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>November/December 2018</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Chopra-Jonas three-day wedding took place in India at the luxurious Taj Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur. The palace, which stretches across 26 acres of land, is the sixth largest private residence in the world. Festivities began November 30 and concluded on December 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was just three days. One Indian ceremony and one Western Christian ceremony and one day of pre-rituals which we have in the Hindu wedding,” Chopra <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told</a> Ellen DeGeneres two months following the couple’s nuptials. “Usually, Indian weddings are like a thousand people, at least. We had only 200, which was mostly family - both of us have giant families. We wanted to keep it super intimate.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>January 2019</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra-Jonas gave the public a few minutes of insight into their relationship as they played Vogue’s edition of “The Newlywed Game.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>March 2019</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after announcing the reunion, The Jonas Brothers, released their hit song, “Sucker.” The three famous brothers joined their leading ladies (Kevin’s wife Danielle Jonas, Nick’s wife Priyanka Chopra, and Joe’s then-fiancé Sophie Turner) in an Anthony Mandler-directed music video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I actually didn’t know much about [The Jonas Brothers],” Chopra revealed on Ellen. "Nick and I both didn’t know much about each other, so we did a show-and-tell after we started dating where we showed each other our work from when we were younger — the embarrassing stuff, like the horrible things. It was great. That’s how we got to know each other’s careers.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2019</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple attended their first Met together as a married couple. It seemed like just yesterday when the two caused outbursts of excited gasps among audiences as they made their 2017 debut (then, as friends). Embracing the theme of camp, Chopra wore a gray Dior gown, complete with a cape, silver cage bodice and colorful, floor-gazing feathers. Jonas suited up in an all-white look with glittering jeweled accents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fashion didn’t end there. The gorgeous couple made several appearances in Cannes, where they flaunted a number of covetable wardrobe ensembles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>December 2019</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was announced that they would be joining forces with Amazon Studios to produce <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a reality series</a> about couples preparing for a sangeet. Mirroring the Jonas and Chopra's own wedding ceremonies, the project will follow engaged partners rehearsing a song and dance routine for a grand performance prior to tying the knot. Chopra shared on Instagram, “the ceremony celebrates the love and magic that comes from friends and family that join together through music and dance the night before a wedding."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>January 2020</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chopra and Jonas strip down to matching white dress shirts and crew socks, paying homage to that notorious Risky Business scene in The Jonas Brothers’ “What a Man Gotta Do” music video.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>March 2020</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Isn’t It Romantic actress opened up about their marriage when she was featured as a guest on an episode of Diane Von Furstenberg’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>podcast</a>, InCharge. "We wrote like five things that we love about each other," she told DVF. "And the first thing he said was 'your ambition.' I've never heard a guy say that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the uncertain times of a global pandemic, the pair encouraged fans to follow suit with contribution efforts in the fight against COVID-19. They donated to 10 charities, helping those facing extreme hardship. Chopra held an Instagram Live conversation with World Health Organization’s doctors, in which Jonas made an appearance in full support.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>November 2020</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For their two year wedding anniversary, Nick Jonas posted a sweet message to celebrate his wife.

My wife was over in Germany finishing up this little movie called The Matrix," Jonas shared during an appearance on The Tonight Show. "And I was like, 'You know, I feel very disconnected from the world, first of all, and now my person.' And I just dug in writing ... within a couple of days I was like, 'Oh, this is a solo album.'
