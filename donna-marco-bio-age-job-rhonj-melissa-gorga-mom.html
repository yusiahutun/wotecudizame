The issue has gotten thus far to involve even Melissa’s family. For instance, her mother Donna Marco.</p><p>Let us tell you more on this topic, among other things in this writing called ‘Donna Marco Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Meet Donna Marco, RHONJ Melissa Gorga Mom</strong></h3><p>Not only Donna Marco also did not go to Teresa Giudice’s wedding to Louie Ruelas, but she has also been more than open about not liking Teresa.</p><p>Between 2011 and March 2023, Melissa’s mom Donna appeared in a total of 23 episodes of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. She has been a part of RHONJ since Season 3.</p><p>As last seen on RHONJ, Donna and the entire Gorga family skipped out on Teresa’s wedding on August 6th after their turbulent relationship reached an all-time low. The two families were yet to repair their relationship, as per a&nbsp;Page Six&nbsp;report from 21 March 2023.</p><p>Also, most recently, Donna was a photo with her sister, Angel, and Margaret Josephs’ss mom, Marge Sr., at her daughter’s skating party from the Season 13 premiere. This was certainly not her only appearance on the season. On S13 E03 called “Boys Will Be Boys” Melissa and Joe sat down with Donna and Angel to discuss Teresa’s wedding.</p><h3><strong>Is Donna Marco Married?</strong></h3><p>As of March 2023, Donna Marco was most certainly not married. She continued to mark being ‘single’ on her social media profile. However, there have been rumors that she has been engaged to someone.</p><p>Donna, the mother of Melissa, Lysa Marco Simpson, and Kim Marco Pirrella, has been married in the past though.&nbsp;She raised her daughters independently after their dad/her husband Anthony John Marco died in a car crash in 1994. Melissa was 17 at the time.</p><p>On RHONJ, fans have heard Melissa often talk about her parents’ rocky marriage. In fact, she even wrote about it in her book Love Italian Style. In the first chapter of her book, titled after her father “The First Man in My Life”, she talked about how her dad cheated on her mom and did not come home every night.</p><h3><strong>Donna Marco Age</strong></h3><p>Donna Marco was born in 1948. So, she turned 74 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Donna Marco Job</strong></h3><p>Before her daughter rose to fame on RHONJ, Donna used to have a career as a nurse. Details of it are yet to be known though.</p><p>For some time now, she has retired from that job also. So, as of now, she just seemed to be enjoying being a reality TV star and a proud mama and grandma.</p><p>Back in the day, Donna went to Toms River South High School and later attended Florham Campus Library.</p><p>If you also need to know, Donna’s favorite music includes “Where’s Judy?”, DJ Dante Cioffi, and NE-YO. While the books that she likes have to be Nursing Drug Handbook, self-help books, and biography books.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Donna Marco’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Donna Marco reportedly had close to $1 million net worth as of march 2023.</p><p>Her daughter Melissa on the other hand was said to have an estimated $3 million and plus as of April 2020. Of course, that was recorded as a combined net worth with her husband Joe Gorga. Melissa and Joe found fame after she joined the cast of RHONJ. Joe is a real estate developer and the ornate mansion they were shown living in during the show was built by him. Melissa, with the help of Teresa, had done all the decorating.</p><h3><strong>Donna Marco Height</strong></h3><p>Fashionable and much younger appearing Donna Marco stands above 5’4” in height.</p><h3><strong>Donna Marco Family</strong></h3><p>Donna has a baby sister called Angel Ceravolo Schlachter. “I am a mom, nonny & overprotective godmother to @melissagorga who is always #OnDisplay #RHONJ” is how Angel introduces herself on her IG @angelsch2. Moreover, she worked at&nbsp;OceanFirst Bank&nbsp;and went to&nbsp;Brick Township High School. Also, at the time of this writing, she was living in Manchester, New Jersey.</p><p>Donna’s other sisters are Diane DeVaughn and Louella Orlick.</p><p>On her Facebook, Donna also mentioned other family members: nieces Jenna Lepore and Tracy Sorensen, cousins Phillip Faccone Sr., Karen Giaquinto Pritchard,&nbsp;Doreen Ceravolo Addison, and Debi Taylor, and nephews David Richardson and David Richardson.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Donna Marco’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Donna Marco’s birthday is on November 6th and that makes her a Scorpio.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Donna Marco From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Donna Marco originally hails from Newark, New Jersey.
