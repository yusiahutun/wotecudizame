And Nicole and I, silently, to ourselves, were battling for Chace's attention. ... We were totally vibing each other," she continued, joking that she and her friend were "trying to c---block" one other.</p><p>"We were, totally, for sure in competition for you," Bilson later added.</p><p>Crawford, 37, laughed, noting that he didn't "pick up on any of that" at the time.</p><p>The "Gossip Girl" alum said he remembered that specific night, recalling how they were at the Boom Boom Room in New York City, which he said "had the great cheeseburgers."</p><p>Bilson then pivoted to something she's "always wanted to tell" Crawford: what went down on her side of things when there were romance rumors between the two of them.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Someone saw us talking or something and the press went with, 'Oh, did Rachel and Chace hook up?'" she said. "My publicist came to me with it and at the time, because I was on a break from my serious relationship, I was like, 'Dude, you have to kill this rumor.'"</p><p>"I freaked out," Bilson continued, admitting that she felt that denying the romance was "f---ed up" and "so mean" towards Crawford.</p><p>"They printed it, but it had a quote from my publicist, like, 'This is completely fabricated and blah blah blah,'" she told Crawford. "And I'm like, 'Wait that's so mean. I would never want to do that to Chace!"</p><p>But it looks like "The O.C." star didn't need to feel guilty about the whole thing as Crawford admitted that didn't know anything about the romance rumors at the time.</p><p>"You're so nice. I didn't even realize that this all went down," he said with a laugh, jokingly adding, "I would have been thrilled [if] they thought we were dating!"</p><p>Bilson noted that she was "happy" she was able to "clear the air" even though it's so many years later.</p><p>"It's crazy. That was like 15 years ago," Crawford said. "New York was so much fun back [then]."</p><a id=gallery-link-4e3a7e10-21c6-4066-b397-7e5cc7f429bf class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4e3a7e10-21c6-4066-b397-7e5cc7f429bf data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c79824e-13f0-4398-ac83-7b3e04c340f0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/4by3/2022/08/29/3af81b3dd0ee43a4a2aa98acb7b2f040_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmbGlfp66ktMSlZJuhnKi8r3nCoZicnV2Yv6LDxaipnWWglsC1edGopJqmk5p6s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
