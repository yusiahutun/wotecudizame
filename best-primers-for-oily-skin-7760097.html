We find it infuriating when we spend time carving out our cheekbones with contour or blending a sultry smoky eye only for our shiny skin and greasy lids to ruin it within hours, or sometimes even minutes, depending on the humidity that day. One of the things we dread the most is catching a glimpse of ourselves in the office bathroom looking ten steps beyond a glossy glow with makeup sliding all over the place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, the right primer can provide a sunbeam of hope in counteracting this effect by “creating a barrier between the skin and makeup, to prevent the oils from your skin from breaking down the makeup,” says Dr. Shereene Idriss, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Idriss Dermatology in NYC. What’s more, many go beyond the call of duty to fend off oils throughout the day and include helpful ingredients that can treat acne, provide sun protection, moisturize skin, and even mitigate oil production over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, if we’re being honest, we didn’t consider primers the most exciting part of our makeup routine. Who really needs or wants another step in their routine? But once we began our research to find the most popular options on the market right now, we discovered they actually provide a strong first line of defense against the enemy that is slippery skin and now we can’t imagine our makeup routine without one.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-smashbox-the-original-photo-finish-smooth--blur-oil-free-foundation-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Smashbox The Original Photo Finish Smooth &amp;amp; Blur Oil-Free Foundation Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9nh88VUr-TglwkOhTP4-cAGBNfw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Smashbox-The-Original-Photo-Finish-Smooth--Blur-Oil-Free-Foundation-Primer-c6f4884ef1db48b584215e334835a902.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The oil-free primer blurs our pores, keeps makeup in place all day, and uses anti-inflammatory, plant-based extracts to calm redness and strengthen the skin barrier.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a little longer to dry than other primers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Smashbox presented me with my ultimate desert island pick of primers: It kept my shiny skin at bay, only letting the right amount of glow shine through and prevented my makeup from sliding into pores and crevices, even after a day spent walking around on a warm day and sweating. But don’t just take my word for it, makeup artists Elizabeth Seropian and Kyle Brown also swear by the primer’s oil-free formula — a crucial element, as most oily skin tends to also be acne-prone — and Brown adds to its list of all-star attributes that work to “instantly smooth, blur, and mattify your complexion for perfectly prepped skin.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And boy, is he right. When I swiped the clear gel across my problem areas, like the larger pores around my nose and dull, dry areas along the sides of my cheeks, it had the same brightening and skin-softening effect on my pores and fine lines as the Instagram Paris filter has on our photos. It gave me enough confidence to leave the house wearing just this primer and not a stitch of makeup, but I was equally thrilled to see how well our foundation rested on top, looking totally natural without any evidence of pilling. We would be remiss if we didn’t also mention that it earned our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Best Primer for Oily Skin award</a> after being scrutinized without mercy by InStyle editors during our tough real-world test last year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I’ll admit, my conception of what a primer would feel like — thick, goopy, restrictive — was totally wrong. Applying the silky formula actually felt like an extension of my skincare routine. The Smashbox formula contains a host of antioxidants, such as vitamins A and E, and grape seed extract,<strong> </strong>to prevent inflammation and damage from environmental stressors (Think: pollution and UV radiation), which exacerbates oily skin and disrupts your skin barrier.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One suggestion: Give this primer at least a minute to dry before rushing to judgment on its efficacy. While it applies like a gel (which may read as greasy to those with oily skin), it dries down to an invisible matte finish that we think you’ll be very pleased with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Grape seed extract, camellia oleifera leaf extract<strong> | Base: </strong>Silicone | <strong>Texture: </strong>Gel | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-nyx-professional-makeup-shine-killer-mattifying-face-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Shine Killer Mattifying Face Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Professional Makeup Shine Killer Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CJl0uf78D7GOkfbJYya3LDl8gQI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-professional-makeup-shine-killer-primer--24fa5a8ced734bd4813d0dc6047ad0fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>NYX leans on<strong> </strong>charcoal to absorb extra oil and provide skin with a natural-looking matte finish.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can leave behind a gray cast if you don’t give it a good shake before applying it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYX should come with a little cape considering the way this humble drugstore brand has developed some of our favorite multitasking, superhero products that save our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eyeliner from smudging </a>and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>eyebrows from budging</a>. Now, Seropian adds another to the list with the recommendation of Shine Killer, a primer that she considers another problem-solving product. “This primer effectively controls shine and maintains a matte complexion,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though its vegan ingredient list is short, it contains one particularly beneficial element for controlling sheen — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>charcoal</a>. If you’re unfamiliar with this powerful powder, its having a moment in nearly every beauty category, from shampoos to toothpaste, for the ability to draw out impurities and, when tapped as a skincare ingredient it soaks up oil with the efficiency of a kitchen sponge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside to using charcoal is that in this particular instance, it can become separated from the other ingredients in the formula and might leave behind a gray residue. The workaround here is to shake the primer super well before applying it so that it all mixes together and creates one unified product that simultaneously hydrates skin and sops up extra oil.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Charcoal powder<strong> | Base: </strong>Silicone <strong>| Texture:</strong> Gel <strong>|</strong> <strong>Size:</strong> 0.67 oz<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-bobbi-brown-vitamin-enriched-face-base></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jSvpKV164e1eZIXcFEXZjjSj4Jo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bobbi-brown-vitamin-enriched-face-base-primer-moisturizer--a8fbde6d5fa24ed4b6509a83b8d2e394.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Working as both a moisturizer and a primer, the formula is filled with super hydrating ingredients that won’t clog pores or feel heavy on skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Grapefruit extract gives the product a light, citrusy scent that may not please everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Following a freshly cleansed face and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>facial roller</a>, what better feeling is there than slathering on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rich moisturizer</a> at the end of your skincare routine? We’ll tell you: It’s massaging this best-selling primer from Bobbi Brown. Its true superpower lies in the smart hybrid formula that saves you time by working as both a skin-softening moisturizer and also a skin-evening primer that grips makeup in place all day for skin that looks radiant and hydrated without veering into oily territory.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Honestly, from the outset, we raised our eyebrows when Brown suggested we try this pricier pick and questioned if the ultra-creamy formula would sit like a heavy blanket on our oily skin or even worse, trigger a breakout. He patiently reassured us (a few times), saying: “Don’t let the thick-looking texture fool you, this product is surprisingly lightweight and easily melts into the skin, leaving nothing but a perfect base for your makeup.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, we reasoned that since we’re getting two products in one (a primer and a moisturizer), we felt better about spending a little extra, especially once we read the ingredient list. The A+ formula is filled with all of the wonderful, non-comedogenic, and non-greasy oils that we not only want, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid and squalane</a>, that our skin needs in order to stay well-balanced, hydrated, and healthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s even better is that those prone to irritation will bask in the calming, anti-inflammatory properties provided by shea butter and grapefruit extracts — just note that grapefruit has a subtle, citrusy scent many people love, but perhaps skip this pick if that’s not your thing.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span><span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamins B, C, and E, hyaluronic acid, grapefruit <strong>| Base: </strong>Water <strong>|</strong> <strong>Texture:</strong> Cream<strong> |</strong> <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-free-fenty-beauty-pro-filtr-instant-retouch-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oil-Free</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Instant Retouch Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Pro Filt&amp;rsquo;r Instant Retouch Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kaACu410Kk0SrhBr6GzvhaGUwNU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pro-filtr-instant-retouch-primer-2a09be601fc04fceb883dfd88ba5bd52.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The unusual pink formula sinks into skin like a dream, leaving us with a lightweight, matte canvas that looks just as good without makeup.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t completely blur pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Having issues with flaky, peeling makeup? Not on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rihanna’s</a> watch! Whether you’re heading to hot yoga or have a particularly grueling summer subway commute, where it always feels 20 degrees hotter this primer from her eponymous brand erases shine and ensures you arrive with fresh-looking skin. Sweat? We don’t know her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re not just saying that, either. Last year, we put the primer up against some stiff competition, testing it against some of the most popular primers on the market. It prevailed, earning our Best Overall title as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the best primer for mattifying skin</a> as it instantly absorbed oil without leaving complexions dry. In fact, this ingenious formula won over our InStyle editor who (formerly) was a self-described primer-hater, but with just two pumps, it covered her entire face with ease.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Seropian agreed, and touted how this long-lasting, oil-free formula stops blush (or bronzer or foundation, or basically anything else) from sliding down your cheekbones and causing the exaggerated wing of a liner that reaches your temples from making its descent, if we’re being totally honest, we’re also drawn to it because, honestly, it’s sexy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s not normally a term we’d use to describe a primer, but everything about it is lush, from the soft, romantic pink color to the enticing lineup of hydrating ingredients, especially glycerin, to transform the skin’s surface into a pillowy-like texture, making this a real treat to use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although it won’t totally erase your pores (but really, what does?), we’re pretty confident that the silky finish it provides will win you over anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Glycerin<strong> | Base: </strong>Water <strong>| Texture: </strong>Cream<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-wear-milk-makeup-hydro-grip-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Wear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vXOwv-UCPey-0Vq6s-E5DKWw5SA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Milk-Makeup-Hydro-Grip-Primer-af3ebcd573474cf0844f5fefb4fa56f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Even without the use of silicones, this primer extends the wear of makeup, as hyaluronic acid forbids dehydration — a true foe when it comes to oily skin — and keeps skin balanced.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It feels pretty sticky when you initially apply it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If this Milk Makeup primer were a band, the InStyle team would be a certified groupie — just take a look back through our archives and you’ll see we’re huge fans (particularly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>when we paired with its setting spray</a>). Our editors even put it up against a rigorous test against 38 other primers and it came on top as the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> best one to keep makeup intact and flawless all day long</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And we are the only admirers — Brown also raves about it. “This primer is a staple in my makeup kit,” he says, adding that he gets the best results by tapping it into the skin with his fingers and letting it get a little tacky before moving on to makeup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know this texture may sound unappealing, but anyone who has fallen victim to the slip and slide effect deeply understands the need for a primer that could be confused for superglue.

To keep my reactive skin happy, I gravitated toward this formula, brimming with glycerin, hibiscus bark and rose geranium extract, all of which are non-comedogenic, moisturizing emollients that blended seamlessly with my makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These enticing ingredients felt extremely soothing when I applied them over a patch of red bumps along the sides of my cheeks that I had the misfortune of sporting at the time.

Yet, even though it didn’t have any of the tackiness I’d normally expect from a long-lasting primer, it kept makeup in place throughout the workday so no one was any wiser to the congestion I had going on underneath — and all without provoking another menacing reaction from my skin I might add.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, what really caught my attention is the formula’s inclusion of red algae extract. Marine algae, particularly red algae, contains bioactive compounds that are filled with an almost ridiculous amount of lipids, proteins, amino acids, minerals, and carbohydrates. This intense cellular makeup, when used in skincare formulations, is known to provide anti-aging benefits as well as improve the skin’s ability to protect itself against damage caused by UV light.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=4></span> In fact, these ingredients left my natural skin looking so cushiony and buoyant after using it consistently for several days I started skipping foundation altogether.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t shy away from the primer’s slight pink tint — it absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue in its wake.

During the test, we found that our foundation applied beautifully, without cracks or patchiness, from the second we smoothed the cloud-like texture over our skin. It sank into our skin immediately, rather than simply sitting on top, to create a hydrated, smooth base that kept our skin feeling velvety all day long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leaving out heavy, potentially pore-clogging irritants like sulfates, oil, gluten, and fragrance, the formula has this weightless effect and makes it safer for sensitive skin types to wear without fear. By making these sensible swaps, Hourglass relies on gentler alternatives, namely titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, to sponge up oil from skin without over-drying it, as well as guarding against damaging rays with SPF 15 sun protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After applying, Seropian says you’ll see a satin, pore-blurring finish ready for whatever makeup you want to wear on top.

She says that many primers rely on ingredients like dimethicone, which is magically able to leave a smooth, silky texture on skin, while helping to fill in fine lines and large pores. On the flip side, Dr. Idriss adds that “silicone-based primers have been known to pill if you’re applying it incorrectly or layering too many products.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To prevent this, it’s important to match the ingredient base of your favorite foundation with your primer. He explains: “If you use a silicone-based primer, use a silicone-based foundation. This will help reduce the likeliness of any pilling and therefore will create a smoother finish.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And word to the wise: If your skin is oily, liquid foundation likely isn’t doing you any favors. Try a powder foundation to sop up oil as it covers imperfections.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When do you apply primer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think: Skincare first, makeup second. “Primers are your base for makeup, so this should be the last step of your skincare routine even after sunscreen in some cases,” says Dr. Idriss.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, you should wait around a minute or two and let it dry fully before putting anything on top to avoid flaky, pilling makeup.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> is a writer covering fashion and beauty trends.
