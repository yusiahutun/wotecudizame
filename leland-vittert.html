When the doctors examined them, they found that the umbilical cord was stuck in his neck, so after some serious discussion, they concluded that they have to do a C-section surgery to remove the umbilical cord.</p><p>As a result, the doctors had to deliver the child artificially to save the mother and baby. Though he survived a major scare and was born as a healthy baby, he was left unable to speak. This incident seriously affected his parents. After much medical counseling, doctors consoled Leland's parents that he would recover slowly. After he turned three years old, he began to utter words and now he is in a profession where speaking is quite in demand.</p><p>This surprised the doctors because according to them there was a minimum chance of survival for both of them.

As a result, the taxpayer's money was wasted in vain. This coverage also added him to the nomination list for the Emmy Award in the same year.</p><p>Nevertheless, his good deeds don't end here. On January 4, 2007, on the show <strong>"friend zone"</strong>, Leland along with his co-host, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tucker Carlson</a>, talked about an incident in Israel.

The woman was then sent to prison where later she changed her path and became a speaker against hate crimes.
