Hold the racket lightly</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fight your instincts. Petchey explains that one of the easiest mistakes people make when they play tennis&nbsp;is to grip&nbsp;the racket too hard. "I see a lot of nervous first-time players do this, because they think, 'if I grip it tighter, the swing is going to have more power', but actually, it's all about having a lighter grip which gives you a better swing. Holding it tight just means you'll get blisters and your play won't be as good. Also, make sure you're holding the racket really low down, so&nbsp;the bottom&nbsp;is almost in the middle sponge of your hand. I see so many people holding it halfway down and three-quarters of the way down;&nbsp;this just means your swing will be far less effective."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>2. Remember the C shape</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Have you got a&nbsp;poor serve? Everyone serves differently and Petchey says remembering 'the C shape' is the easiest way to achieve a good one: "You can't go too wrong if you make a C shape when you serve – starting from the top and curving round – you can&nbsp;easily get power and control behind your hit. The C gives you enough time to do a great ball toss;&nbsp;let the ball bounce on the ground once&nbsp;and, by that time, you're coming back to finish the rest of your C, making the position absolutely perfect for hitting the ball. Don't make a half C, go the whole way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>3. Angle your feet</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is no secret that&nbsp;footwork is key in tennis, but Petchey reveals that simply&nbsp;changing how you stand can make all the difference to your game. "If your feet are angled in the right way, you're far more likely to hit the ball exactly where you want it to go in the court. Position your feet so one foot is facing the direction you want it go – this will usually be diagonal –&nbsp;and place&nbsp;the other one so that it is facing forward."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>4. Consider your eating habits</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Petchey's philosophy is the cliché:&nbsp;everything in moderation.&nbsp;"I have three litres of water and good, wholesome, healthy food. I don't think you should overeat carbs as a general rule, but lots of protein is essential. When it comes to food, I believe in everything, even a little bit of sugar. I would recommend eating soon after your tennis game, it's good to get something in your body. Eat over an hour before you get out on the court, you won't be&nbsp;ready to go if you eat just before."</p><img alt="A young Andy Murray and his coach at the time Mark Petchey" title="A young Andy Murray and his coach at the time Mark Petchey" width=2521 height=1891 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/26/1467019015-2006-56943508.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mark Petchey with Andy Murray in 2006.

Remember&nbsp;'SSR'</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bring out of the best in your tennis skills by training&nbsp;anaerobically. "Going for runs and bike rides is a great way to build up your fitness levels to prepare you for tennis. Anaerobic means living without oxygen. You want to train in this way, with an intense&nbsp;40 seconds 'on' and 40 seconds 'off'&nbsp;so practicing drills&nbsp;are perfect for playing on the court. If you want to get good at tennis, you have to remember SSR:&nbsp;short, sharp and rest. This will keep you alert on the court and you'll know when to push yourself and when to rest."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>6. Watch the ball</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This one sounds obvious,&nbsp;but Petchey says looking at the ball, rather than at the spot&nbsp;you hope it's going to go, is one of the best things you can do to perfect your serve. "When they serve, rookies are always looking at where they want the ball to go on the court. They should be keeping the eye on the ball when it bounces onto the strings of their racket.&nbsp;From the serve toss to a rally, don't keep your eyes off the ball. When you watch its&nbsp;every move, it'll mean you're in control on the court."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7. Go back to basics</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Petchey says we should never underestimate the significance of the small things we can do to improve our tennis game. "All the best players in the world start&nbsp;off by practising throwing up balls and catching them and hitting tennis balls against a wall. If you don't live near to a court and want to step up your game, then it's easy. It's all the little things that add up. Throwing&nbsp;balls up as high as you can and catching them will bring on a great ball toss. You don't need to have a massive&nbsp;court, an&nbsp;outfit and the best racket out on the market to get great at tennis."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.neilson.co.uk_beach_activities_tennis_tennis-2Dacademy-2Dmark-2Dpetchey&d=CwMFAg&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=5ld3MZMgJdnXGVqytNesax4brI4gJR-7obu4dIRgzBeEJ58ltygpazH0KlhtXAd4&m=vVJhfKplddsfcfD3IhMZmCZuUn7EwOO6Mlk79_ONKkU&s=-hvSYLXN_t-203emojKofZxJv55mQaayd5mu_8OhljQ&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Neilson class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Neilson</strong></a><strong data-redactor-tag=strong> Holidays launched the Mark Petchey tennis programme this year across its Greek and Turkish Beachclubs</strong>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>***</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>MORE LIKE THIS</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX5u2tbrErKpmr5WhuaOxyKeeaKaVrMBwrZJwa3FoX6iyt7HNZpyaq6liwaq80mamp2WYpMRuwM5mnp6sXZy8sLCMmqtmrJWju6q%2FjKqsopubocZurdJmq6iklGKvunnAp5uyZZ2qv7Ot2KxknrBdmLyir8do</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
