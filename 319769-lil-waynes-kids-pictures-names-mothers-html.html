It is more likely for a youngster who grew up in the same neighbourhood as Wayne to drop out and resort to a life of crime. Lil Wayne had his first daughter at only fifteen with his childhood sweetheart, Antonia Johnson. Fast forward to 2019, and Lil Wayne's baby mothers are quite a number. One fantastic thing about this extended family is that Wayne keeps them all together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db67cac2afbededb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kecalf Cunningham: What you should know about Aretha Franklin's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE:</strong> Rory John Gates education, net worth, siblings</p><h2>Who are Lil Wayne’s Children?</h2><p class=align-left>The rapper has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four children</a> - three sons and one daughter -all of them from different mothers. Everyone knows his first and only daughter, Reginea, that is all grown up. She was born on November 29, 1998, out of very young love. The second oldest child of Lil Wayne is Dwayne Michael Carter III, who was born on October 22, 2008, to Sarah Vivian. The third child is probably the most famous because of the personality of the mother. He's named Cameron Carter, and his mother is the gorgeous Lauren London.</p><p class=align-left>Lil Wayne’s youngest son is Neal Carter. The child’s mother is singer Nivea. Neal was born on November 2009, a year when Wayne’s professional career was at its height. Lil Wayne's popularly quoted saying he isn't looking for a fifth kid; however, he's synonymous with contradicting statements.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lisa Thorner: 5 interesting facts about Damon Wayans' ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE:</strong> Blake Griffin parents, siblings, wife, height</p><h2>Reginae Carter, 20</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db67cac2afbededb.jpeg><p class=align-left>Is Reginae Carter Lil Wayne's daughter? It is quite hard to accept this reality when you work out the math. Well, she’s the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teenage daughter</a> of Lil Wayne, who was born to his high school sweetheart. They named her after Wayne’s stepfather who has since passed away – Reginald. Although Wayne and Antonia Wright, Reginae’s mother married in 2004, the relationship didn't last, and they split in 2006. Regardless of this unfortunate eventuality, they still keep close contact.</p><p class=align-left>Reginae attended The Clark Atlanta University, and that’s when she was spotted in the company of bodyguards. She is one of Lil Wayne’s kids that have followed in his footsteps. She can rap and sing and is currently signed to Wayne's record label, Young Money Entertainment. Reginae began her career as a professional rapper and singer as a member of the teenage R & B group, OMG Girls; however, she exited in 2010. Lil Wayne is always in close contact with Reginae, and has been part of her life until today.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/71accc0827e5912c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Olivia Namath: 5 quick facts about Joe Namath's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most people were shocked in August 2008 when several media outlets reported that Reginae had died in an automobile accident. It was eventually discovered to be a hoax. Wayne had to personally release a statement denying the rumours as many fans were unsure of the authenticity of the report.</p><h2>Dwayne Carter Michael III, 10</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpg><p class=align-left>Another member of Lil Wayne’s family is Dwayne who was born on October 22, 2008, to Sarah Vivian. This was at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Lil Wayne named the child in the traditional family way. The ten-year-old is commonly referred to as Lil Tuney by his family members. Lil Wayne and Sarah met in 2005, and they were in a relationship that was mostly on and off. Sarah Vivian was a crazy Wayne fan, and they met during one of his concerts. After a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">short affair</a>, they had a son.</p><p class=align-left>Sarah enters a rather long list of Lil Wayne kids’ mothers who are not in an active relationship with the rapper. Although they separated a long time ago, Wayne frequently sees his kid. You cannot miss him in any of the many pictures of Lil Wayne kids with their father. Currently, Dwayne Carter is attending a secondary school in Atlanta, G, and he lives with his mother and half-sister Essence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/677f2340f7cb3a6a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>John Edward Thomas Moynahan: What you should know about Tom Brady's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE: </strong>Kate Middleton bio, height, engagement ring, family, latest pics</p><h2>Cameron Lenox Carter, 10</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ab58c5b98f116e62.jpg><p class=align-left>Cameron was born on September 9, 2009, to Lauren London, a famous actress.
