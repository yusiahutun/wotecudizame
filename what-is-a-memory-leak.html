But sometimes, a small problem here or there could lead to the slowing down of a computer. One of the main reasons for this is a memory leak.</p><p>But what exactly is a memory link, and how does it happen? Can you do anything to resolve this issue? Let's take a look.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-is-a-memory-leak>What Is a Memory Leak?</h2><p>Computer memory is temporarily stored and retrieved from <a href=#>random access memory (RAM)</a> for running various applications.</p><p>A memory leak is a portion of an application that uses memory from RAM without finally freeing it. The result is that an app crashes the next time it attempts to use more memory, which can impact on the performance of a computer.</p><h2 id=how-to-detect-a-memory-leak>How to Detect a Memory Leak</h2><p>When the system undergoes a shortage of memory, you are most likely to receive an on-screen warning message along the lines of "running out of memory.: The performance starts degrading and the system begins malfunctioning.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can find a memory leak by looking at your system’s RAM usage. Running the Windows Performance Monitor can help find a memory leak. You won't find the source of leakage using this method, but it will help you investigate whether a memory link exists.</p><p>To run the Performance monitor, hold<strong> Windows Key + R</strong> simultaneously to open the <strong>Run </strong>command. Then, enter <strong>mdsched.exe</strong>.</p><p>After that, click <strong>OK </strong>and select <strong>Restart Now</strong> to check problems. The test will start and may take several hours to complete. Follow the on-screen instructions after the completion of the test to detect memory leaks.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Windows-Memory-Diagonstic.jpg><h2 id=the-consequences-of-memory-leaks>The Consequences of Memory Leaks</h2><p>Consequences depend on the use of client or server applications. The extent of these is listed below.</p><h3 id=client-applications-desktops-and-mobile-phones>Client Applications (Desktops and Mobile Phones)</h3><p>For these, the consequences are not very serious, as the memory allocated is released when the application is terminated. So, there is no system instability. Some problems encountered by excessive memory usage can be:</p><ul><li>Your system may begin slowing down.</li><li>Apps on your computer might close abruptly.</li><li>The computer's application code allocating memory can crash and cause bugs.</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=server-applications>Server Applications</h3><p>The problem of memory leakage gets worse in this case, as the server has to run for a long time without restarting. The problems here are the same as those in the case of desktop applications. The memory is consumed over days, weeks, months, and the server performance starts degrading. Bugs start to appear, causing the server to stop working eventually.</p><h2 id=how-to-prevent-a-memory-leak>How to Prevent a Memory Leak</h2><p>Most programming languages today are included with features to assist developers with automatic memory management. They use a system called<strong> Garbage Collector</strong>, which helps in freeing up memory that is not in use. There are various types of garbage collectors, and understanding how your application’s garbage collector functions is an important step in preventing memory leaks.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Another method to prevent memory leakage is by writing a code that disposes of unneeded resources. You will be required to write specific code indicating the application that the resource’s work has finished, and there is no further memory use. Ensure that loops are executed completely to avoid memory leak occurrence.</p><p>Sometimes, you may need to restart the system to prevent a memory leak. However, doing this can impact open apps. This is therefore the least recommended option, and you should close all apps if you resort to this.</p><h2 id=how-to-fix-a-memory-leak-in-windows>How to Fix a Memory Leak in Windows</h2><p>Memory leaks may be hard to detect and fix at an early stage of development. However, some of the recommended methods of fixing memory leaks are:</p><h3 id=ending-a-program-using-the-most-memory>Ending a Program Using the Most Memory</h3><p>One of the best methods to prevent memory leaks is to terminate the program that is using most of the computer's memory.</p><p>Press <strong>CTRL + Shift + ESC</strong> keys to start <strong>Task Manager.</strong> Under the <strong>Process</strong> tab, find a program using most of the memory. Now, right-click the program to <strong>End Task </strong>and<strong> </strong>close this program. Restart your PC and you will find that the memory leak has been wiped off.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/End-Task.jpg><h2 id=using-windows-10-built-in-tools>​​​​Using Windows 10 Built-In Tools</h2><p>Windows 10 has a built-in diagnostics tool to provide accurate analysis in determining the main cause of the problem.</p><p>Go to <strong>Search</strong>, type <strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic </strong>and click it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.jpg><p>After that, choose <strong>Restart now </strong>to check for problems.
