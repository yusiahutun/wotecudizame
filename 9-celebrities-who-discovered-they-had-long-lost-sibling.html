It turns out that Dwayne also has five other half-siblings, who all discovered each other through DNA testing. While Rocky's five children didn't get the chance to see their father before he passed, they have since met up and spent time with Rocky's brother Ricky.</p><p>"They deserve to be loved, like any other child does, whether they’re rich and famous or not," Ricky told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sports Illustrated</strong></a>. "We talked many times, just me and him, one on one. We fought about [the way he treated his family], argued about it.

Their mother had given up Patricia for adoption in 1963 when Oprah was nine years old and living with her father. Patricia held onto the secret for several years and then in 2011, she reached out to Oprah's niece. After confirming things through a DNA test, Oprah's family told her -- and they all reunited on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>"What's so extraordinary about Patricia…is that [she's] known this secret since 2007…She never once thought to go to the press," Oprah <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said</strong></a><strong> </strong>on her show.

The pair eventually met up and Cheryl <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>shared</strong></a> they instantly felt "like we had known each other forever."</p><p>"I was a little nervous meeting face-to-face because you just never know. And then we met face-to-face and it’s like looking at yourself in the mirror. When you see someone on social media, you wonder do they still look like that?

Unfortunately, it sounds like the pair never got to meet before Dwayne passed away.</p><p>“My one brother worked for DC Comics. He worked for DC Comics and Marvel Comics and he was in charge of a department, of an animation department…for bringing characters of color on screen,” he said on the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>You Made It Weird</strong></a>" podcast.</p><p><a href=#><strong>7. Janice Dickinson</strong></a></p><p>In 2017, Janice Dickinson and her two sisters learned that they had a long lost half-sister named Gloria "Bunny" Dickinson. It turns out that Janice's father had a relationship prior to welcoming Janice and her sisters. The discovery was made after Bunny's nephew "researched their family genealogy." Bunny went on to reach out to her sister and they were later able to meet up in person -- and Janice brought cameras along.</p><p>"From the moment Bunny called me, I knew that she was my sister because the cadence of her voice. Us Dickinson ladies are just tall Texan ravishing beauties," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Daily Mail</strong></a>, later adding, "I never knew.

We did keep staring at each other, going, 'We’ve got the same eyes, the same cheeks, the same dimples.' It's so weird," KT <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said</strong></a>. "They grew up 35 miles from where I lived and I worked in the ice-cream shop in St Andrews and they'd regularly come. It's pretty likely I’ve done them a double cone.
