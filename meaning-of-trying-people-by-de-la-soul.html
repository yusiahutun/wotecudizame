At its core, the song explores the challenges and complexities of life, relationships, personal growth, and the human experience. While analyzing some standout lyrics, we can uncover unexpected and imaginative themes that ultimately connect back to the song's overarching exploration of resilience and the pursuit of self-improvement.One noteworthy lyric that captures attention is when Dave raps, "Am I just another lost in the pack? We Horshack shit, you know, laugh it off." This line presents a theme of individualism and self-identity. It questions whether one's existence is just another face lost in the crowd, and highlights the importance of finding one's unique purpose and voice.

It explores the desire for companionship, while acknowledging the complexity of balancing personal freedom with the commitment of marriage and starting a family. It portrays the longing for deep connections and the recognition that love is not just a fleeting emotion but an integral part of life.Posdnous contributes to the themes by rapping, "Throughout my change to grow, some of my people got left behind. They didn't listen for the gun as I leaped from off the line." This particular line reflects the theme of personal development and leaving the past behind. It recognizes the need for growth and the choices individuals must make to evolve. It also highlights the difficulties in maintaining relationships when personal growth takes people on diverging paths. The metaphor of not listening for the gun suggests that some individuals might not be receptive to change and find it challenging to adapt and move forward.Discussing the theme of guidance and support, Posdnous further raps, "C. Smith said to hold on. My brother Luck said to hold on. My nigga Dave said to hold on. My nigga Mase said to hold on. Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on. Ayo, y'all, we need to hold on." This verse emphasizes the importance of leaning on others during difficult times. It suggests seeking solace in the support and wisdom of friends and loved ones. The repeated plea to "hold on" symbolizes an unwavering determination to persevere and surpass obstacles by relying on the strength found in human connections.By analyzing these standout lyrics, we can perceive the song 'Trying People' as an introspective journey that explores various facets of life.
