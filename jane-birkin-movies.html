In 1966, she had a small part in the arty thriller Blowup, and received much attention thanks to a nude scene. Blowup would go on to become one of the most iconic movies of the ’60s, and from there Birkin took on more and more roles in European arthouse films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-138634875.jpg><p>Following Blowup, Birkin was in high demand, and appeared in groovy ’60s movies like Kaleidoscope and Wonderwall. In Wonderwall, Birkin played a model named Penny Lane, and the movie featured psychedelic visuals and music from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">George Harrison</a>. It doesn’t get more ’60s than that! (And yes, it inspired the popular ’90s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oasis song</a> of the same name!)</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">60 Years of Beatlemania: 10 Fab Beatles Moments From 1964</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-540775141.jpg><p>1969 would be a pivotal year for Birkin, as she met Serge Gainsbourg, who would become her partner, when they starred together in the French film Slogan. Surprisingly, when Birkin was first cast in the role of the young woman with whom Gainsbourg has an affair, she didn’t speak any French, but she soon learned the language and audiences were endeared by the way she spoke French with an English accent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-607385948.jpg><p>That same year, Birkin permanently relocated to France and released a provocative duet with Gainsbourg, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Je t’aime… moi non plus</a>.” She also costarred in the hit French thriller The Swimming Pool, playing a sullen yet stylish teen who gets caught up in some very adult drama.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-1262746796.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Singing in the ’70s</h2><p>In the ’70s, Birkin released three albums, all with songs written by Gainsbourg. In 1971, she and Gainsbourg had a daughter, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a>, who would go on to become an accomplished singer and actress herself. Birkin continued acting, and notably had a role as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brigitte Bardot</a>‘s lover in Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman in 1973.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-607394566.jpg><p>Birkin then branched out into horror movies like Seven Deaths in the Cat’s Eyes and Dark Places and comedies like I’m Losing My Temper and Catherine & Co. She also appeared in Gainsbourg’s directorial debut, titled (what else?) Je t’aime moi non plus, in 1976. Like much of Gainsbourg’s work, the film proved controversial due to its risqué nature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-104791140.jpg><p>In 1978, Birkin appeared in one of her most high-profile roles, in the ensemble cast of the 1978 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agatha Christie</a> adaptation Death on the Nile. She would appear in another Christie adaptation, Evil Under the Sun, in 1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-542345516.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jane Birkin the mature actress</h2><p>Birkin will forever be known for her devil-may-care style in the ’60s and ’70s, and with some exceptions, many French Jane Birkin movies aren’t well-known to mainstream American audiences. Being known as an ingenue can be a trap as an actress matures, but Birkin kept acting into the ’80s and beyond.</p><p>In 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg broke up, and the actress began a relationship with French director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacques Doillon</a>. She starred in two of his films in the early ’80s, The Prodigal Daughter and La Pirate. In The Prodigal Daughter, she played a troubled woman who leaves her husband and returns home — only to discover her father is having an affair. Reflecting on the 1981 film, Birkin said, “[It was] the first time that I had received such reviews when the critics thought I was good on screen. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It touched me deeply to be taken seriously</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-1257595655.jpg><p>Birkin worked steadily throughout the ’80s, with roles in Love on the Ground, Beethoven’s Nephew, Leave All Fair and La femme de ma vie. In 1988, she starred in two films by the trailblazing director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agnès Varda</a>, Kung Fu Master (a drama in which she plays a woman who has an affair with a teenager) and Jane B. par Agnès V.&nbsp;(a documentary about Birkin’s life that weaves in elements of fiction).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-96954291.jpg><p>Some Jane Birkin movies in the ’90s included La Belle Noiseuse, Daddy Nostalgia, Same Old Song and A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries. By the ’00s, Birkin was still acting, and she stepped behind the camera for the first time in 2007, writing, directing and starring in Boxes, a film based on her life and loves. After so many years of being a muse, Birkin finally got a chance to tell her own story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-1336760778.jpg><p>In 2021, Birkin was the subject of a documentary directed by her daughter, Jane by Charlotte. In recent years, some of the more famous Jane Birkin movies have won over a new generation of fans, as she’s a constant subject of fashion inspiration on social media. Birkin’s singular charisma is undeniable, whether we’re watching her in one of the seductive ’60s thrillers of her early years or an acclaimed arthouse film from later on.</p><p><strong>Read on for more <a href=#>’60s</a> icons!</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raquel Welch: 10 Iconic Movies Starring the Hollywood Bombshell</a></p><p><a href=#>Young Cher: See the Singer’s Fashion Transformation and Her Wildest Looks</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Bfrq%2BxjJugq6OZo3quu9WinKw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
