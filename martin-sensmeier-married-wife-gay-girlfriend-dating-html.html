The actor first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">caught</a> the bug for acting when he was in school.</p><p>"It happened in fourth grade. My teacher, Celia Eklund, everything she taught I fell in love with. She taught history and I fell in love with Egypt and the pyramids. I fell in love with Mexico and the Mayans. She directed a school play and I fell in love with acting. I daydreamed about it all day long."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>But instead of acting, he studied welding at the University of Alaska Anchorage for two years.
