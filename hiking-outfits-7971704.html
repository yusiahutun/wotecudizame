Even if the trailhead isn’t calling your name, or you live nowhere close to L.A.’s celebrity hot spot, Runyon Canyon, at the very least, you’ll be running errands this autumn. And you’ll be doing that in casual clothing, right?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as we adore sweater weather and all things plaid, there’s more to fall fashion than just those two staples. “Somewhere between the rise of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lug-sole boots</a> and Patagonia normcore having a moment, the faux-outdoorsy style has graduated from a micro trend to its own category of fall staples,” observes stylist Natalie Cantell. “If you secretly love your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Hokas</a> (like I do), prepare to rejoice in this new season’s offering of quilted puffer jackets, caps, and loads more utilitarian style.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This season, get inspired to lace up a pair of practical boots, unearth a cute, cozy cap, and try out a fun new jacket instead of that same old hooded sweatshirt. There is plenty of hiking-inspired attire to be found this fall, whether or not you’re actually venturing out into the wilderness or among wildlife. Ahead, check out 21 stylish hiking outfits that you’ll be excited to wear outdoors, no matter where the day takes you. Adventure — and yes, plenty of excuses to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wear leggings</a> — awaits!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-classic-barbour-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Classic Barbour Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Cambridge, might not be the first person to come to mind when searching for hiking outfit inspiration, but she’s got the look down pat. Kate Middleton is particularly fond of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Barbour</a>, the storied British lifestyle brand that traces its roots to 1894.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Barbour jackets have long been the uniform of stylish Brits braving the rain, from Princess Di (being rained on) in Scotland to Alexa Chung (being rained on) at Glastonbury,” notes Cantell. Not only is the iconic wax fabric jacket ideal for taking on less-than-sunny days, but it also is essential in any classic wardrobe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-retro-windbreaker></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Retro Windbreaker</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Rachpoot/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hiking outfits are the perfect opportunity to lean into those normcore vibes that we all secretly (or not so secretly) love. Just pair a vintage-looking windbreaker with your favorite leggings, scrunchy socks, and sneakers like Kendall Jenner for a playful but still practical hiking outfit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-statement-accessories></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Statement Accessories</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Rachpoot/MEGA/GC Images/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your workout wear tends to be more muted, inject some color into your attire with a few statement accessories. We love how Emily Ratajkowski livened up her hiking outfit with bright orange sneakers, a blue baseball cap, and, perhaps the most useful item, a fun printed water bottle.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-your-favorite-sneakers-and-sweats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In Your Favorite Sneakers and Sweats</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we won’t advocate for making a designer handbag — much less a Hermès Kelly — part of your hiking outfit, we do love this look for a more urban outing. Think of something like a quick stroll through Central Park on your way to The American Museum of Natural History; comfortable and cohesive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This high-low look is how everyone I know in New York dresses for all of December and January,” says Cantell, who adds that "We all invested in sweats to the point where we’ve collectively deemed them worthy of wearing out of the house — just further evidence that nearly anything is acceptable under a good, oversized wool coat.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wearing-lug-sole-boots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wearing Lug-Sole Boots</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Gotham/GC Images/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lug-soled boots may be one of the most practical footwear trends we’ve seen in years and is the perfect shoe for any hiking outfit. Although the style isn’t dominating trend stories quite as much as they were a few years ago, Cantell agrees that they’re a fall staple well worth the investment. Notably, Proenza Schouler, Chloé, and Isabel Marant are all offering great options for this season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The added height protects you — and your boots — from mud puddles and other messes on the trail, while also gripping the terrain a lot better than flat-soled styles or sneakers. Plus, these chunky shoes are equally at home in an actual forest or hiking the urban jungle. The destination is up to you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-favorite-fleece></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Favorite Fleece</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re partial to Patagonia or never leave home without your North Face, no hiking outfit is complete without your favorite fleece. For a more elevated option,&nbsp;“Keep an eye on Nanushka for chic fleece styles,” Cantell suggests, “And&nbsp; definitely don’t sleep on their menswear selection."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pair your fleece with leggings and a crossbody or belt bag for an outdoor adventure. And if you insist on hiking in a pair of cozy Uggs, opt for a pair with a rubber sole or thicker tread so you don’t accidentally slip.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-plaid-please></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Plaid, Please</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing many people think of when picturing a hiking outfit is something plaid. For a more fashionable take on the pattern, “Don’t miss Kate Moss’s beyond understated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>plaid-printed leather shirt and jeans look </a>from the Bottega runway in Milan this February,” Cantell suggests. Whether it’s a simple flannel shirt, or more rugged wool outerwear, wearing plaid feels almost as essential as carrying a water bottle. You could probably do without, but why would you want to?&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-neon-accents></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Neon Accents</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket is incredible on its own (and great if you’re worried about getting separated from your group!), but the matching neon green stitching and shoelaces are next-level.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-colorful-raincoat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Colorful Raincoat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s a chance of rain on the day of your outing, you’ll want to make a colorful raincoat part of your hiking outfit. Look for something waterproof and wind-resistant in a bright hue (this is not the time for camouflage), and wear it with a comfortable sweater, jeans, and socks. As the scouts say, “Be prepared.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-sturdy-shacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Sturdy Shacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Robert Kamau/GC Images/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The shacket may have been the best thing to happen to transitional outerwear since… the poncho? While shackets were ubiquitous a few seasons ago, they’re still incredibly practical, especially as a layering piece. If your hiking outfit needs to be versatile, try using a shacket as your outermost layer and wearing a super chunky knit underneath. You’ll have the warmth of a puffer coat without the added heft.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-boiler-suit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Boiler Suit</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A one-piece boiler suit — especially with plenty of pockets — makes for a super-easy hiking outfit. Wear a tank underneath (or turtleneck if temps are cooler), and pair it with chunky boots or sturdy sneakers. Bonus points for a belt bag that you actually fit through the loops.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-combat-boots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Combat Boots</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If legitimate hiking boots aren’t something you have in your closet already, don’t worry; a trusty pair of combat boots can do the trick. You can create a hiking outfit with a woodsier vibe in other ways, like with a buffalo plaid jacket or an ax. (Just kidding about the ax.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-an-unironic-hunter-orange-fleece></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>An Unironic Hunter Orange Fleece</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>PHOTOLOGY/GC Images/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have to throw together a hiking outfit at the last minute — like, you’re already en route — make the most of your surroundings, and see what the nearest rest stop souvenir shop has in store. Odds are you’ll find some bright orange gear made for hunters that will suit you in a pinch. Look for something oversized and loud, like the half-zip seen above on Hailey Bieber. For added effect, pick up a trucker hat in a contrasting color at checkout. Somehow, it works.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-utility-shirt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Utility Shirt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A camp or utility shirt is the lighter-weight cousin of a shacket. It usually has short sleeves, two pockets on the chest, and buttons all the way to the collar. Similar to a boilersuit, it prioritizes practicality — the pockets — over panache. Wear it with your go-to jeans and boots for a hiking outfit that looks comfortable and confident. It’s really that easy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-cargo-pants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Cargo Pants</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cargo pants, while more utilitarian than outdoorsman, are certainly hiking outfit-approved. Honestly, the more pockets the better. Look for a pair in earth tones that will go with anything, or, find a style that matches your go-to coat. “I highly recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Outdoor Voices belted cargo pants</a> if you’re considering actual outdoorsiness,” suggests Cantell, adding, “and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Stella McCartney’s wide-leg vegetarian leather style</a> if you’re not.” Keep the rest of the outfit simple so the cargo pants make a statement.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-a-lightweight-down-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In a Lightweight Down Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Vanni Bassetti/Getty Images.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When in doubt, go the tried and true route. That can apply to choosing a hiking trail or putting together the perfect outfit for a day spent at different elevations. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Patagonia’s super lightweight down jackets</a> are incredibly warm and cozy but are also easy to stuff in a bag or backpack as temperatures warm up. While we love this bright blue color, stick a neutral or earth tone if you want to better blend in with your surroundings.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-practical-fanny-pack></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Practical Fanny Pack</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Vanni Bassetti/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While leather belt bags are great for wearing on the go, they can be a bit too tiny and delicate for carrying on an actual hike. Choose a sturdy fanny pack made from a water-resistant material like wax-coated canvas or nylon.&nbsp;"A quick walk around downtown N.Y.C. may inform you that the only style worth knowing is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>re-nylon Prada belt bag</a>, and the correct way to wear it is cross-body,” says Cantell. And pro tip: The more compartments, the better.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-an-unexpected-animal-print></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In an Unexpected Animal Print</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Vanni Bassetti/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you aren’t worried about blending in, we recommend wearing a hiking outfit that will stand out. Have fun with an animal print that you won’t find in nature — like the bright yellow leopard seen above — while keeping the rest of your outfit simple with jeans, sneakers, and a long-sleeve shirt. It’s a cheeky way to show off your wild side.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-puffer-vest></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Puffer Vest</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Vanni Bassetti/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The difference between an average hiking outfit and one that is actually useful comes down to one thing: layers. If a full-length jacket sounds like it will be too sweaty, opt for a more breathable vest in fleece or down material as your outermost layer. Start the day by wearing the vest over a windbreaker to keep the elements at bay and move the vest closer to your core as temperatures get lower.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-boots-and-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Boots and Leggings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A boots-and-leggings outfit seems pretty basic but is actually quite practical for hiking purposes. Tucking your pants into boots with a higher shaft helps to keep the elements — and bugs — off of your skin. This is particularly important when hiking in wooded areas known for having ticks. The more covered up you can be, the better.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-earth-tones-only></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Earth Tones Only</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Melodie Jeng/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not ready to go full-on camouflage, try styling a hiking outfit that consists solely of earth tones. Dark greens and rich browns, even in something as simple as a hooded sweatshirt, are an easy way to blend in with Mother Nature without having to buy something new to wear on your trek</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6KioqaXYry2wMWiq6xlZ26EcoOPbQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
