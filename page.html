You see, I’d left my chef’s knife at home and seriously, people, I never knew I was the kind of person who had to have their creature comforts to cook. In fact, I get some sort of sick enjoyment out of making do with whatever’s in front of me (see also: my shoebox kitchen with a mini-stove, single tiny counter and a climbing baby over- under- and hanging-off-of-foot, putting everything he can find into his mouth) but I got bested last week by a drawer full of dull knives and not a sharpener in sight. You don’t want to know what the best of the lot did to <a href=#>some tomatoes</a> — it should be ashamed of itself! Plus, there were the small matters of a city baby who refused to sleep in such foreign places with large rooms, crickets and <a href=#>scary</a> <a href=#>flowers</a> outside and the fact that we’d only rented the house for a week. What were we thinking? Two weeks! A month! More!

Yesterday, I was eating a drippy peach we’d bought from one of those roadside stands that have baskets of homegrown stuff and instruct you to leave your money in a little container (you know, just like in Manhattan!) over the sink and two tiny deer and a bunny appeared in the woodsy area next to our house and seriously, I cannot believe that people own these places and willingly rent them to strangers.

We headed out last weekend to a house we’ve rented (with enough spare bedrooms for grandparents to come and babysit catch up with their <a href=#>favorite grandson</a>, because we are <i>brilliant</i>, friends, absolutely brilliant) and I’m dispatching from the beach this week. I’ve already had a dinner with friends that involved <a href=#>multiple</a> <a href=#>formats</a> of broiled cheese, several tastes of local wines, watched the sunset, had my first and second full night’s sleep in weeks, and now with the promise of Dunkin Donuts coffee and freckles in my near future, I have totally arrived.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4775 height=3183 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/08/everyday-chocolate-cake.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Chocolate gets stiffed every summer in my kitchen and this one has been no different. Apparently, the only time I have come near chocolate with a ten foot pole this summer was more than six weeks ago, when I made some impromptu <a href=#>chocolate doughnut holes</a> in the lull between rhubarb/strawberry season and every awesome fruit since. And I love chocolate like <a href=#>some people love bagels</a>.

We were eating ribs for dinner and we hadn’t even needed to leave our apartment to get them.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2402 height=1600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/4833941545_0c7c5409a1_o-1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a><p>I have to apologize in advance: this is a <a href=#>cookbook</a> reject. I know! “A reject?!” you’re probably thinking. “Now why would I want your rejects?” Because this is a <i>delicious</i> reject; it failed because I decided to go in another direction, such a different direction that about the only thing the other one has in common is the word “buckle” and I’m probably renaming it anyway. Gosh, I sure like to make things difficult, though that’s not really news.</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1244 height=831 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/4819859550_857986cd86_o.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> [Er, croutons not pictured.] Here’s the thing: If you told me you were serving succotash with or for dinner, I’d inwardly groan. People, I’ve had all sorts of succotash — a summery stew of corn and lima beans, often with tomatoes, yet still so bland that no added butter or cream saves it for me, and when adding butter and cream don’t save something for me, you know something is terribly wrong — and can’t think of one that I wanted to run home and make for myself. It might be because it’s usually in the off-season, when the above come frozen and no, it’s just not the same. It might also be because I once had a roommate that would open cans of succotash, <i>not</i> drain it, heat it in the microwave and eat it straight and guys, it’s been many, many years and still, my stomach turns. Don’t ever live with me. I’m a jerk.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5191 height=3462 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/raspberry-brown-sugar-gratin1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> [Note: This recipe got fresh photos in 2018. It’s still as ugly as it is delicious.]<p>This is the ugliest, best thing I have ever made with three ingredients and the happy ending to three weeks of obsessing.

It wasn’t fair. It felt outright mean. For people as berserk about summer tomatoes as I am — people who avoid them in the off seasons, when they’re tomatoes in name only — being reminded of that which is as impossibly far off as the notion that there are days in the summer that are so hot, we actually long for the kind of weather that requires Gore-Tex and hot cocoa. It’s basically crazy talk.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1866 height=1245 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/peach-and-blueberry-cobbler.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I am having the worst luck with peaches this summer. Without fail, every week I am lured in by the most fragrant peaches I’ve ever sniffed at the market, and without fail, the day after they come home with me, they’re mush. Sweet, peachy mush. To eat one requires hovering over a sink, and then a mop and a shirt change anyway and no, sadly, I am not speaking of <a href=#>the baby’s messes</a>. These are not bad problems to have; “Woe is me! My peaches are too juicy!” doesn’t exactly make a room nod in sympathy but the week I made the mistake of letting the peaches go <i>a whole 48 hours uneaten</i> the only thing left to with the misshapen lot was to bake them.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnx4go54nqinl5uw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
