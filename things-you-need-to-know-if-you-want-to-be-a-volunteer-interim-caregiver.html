"Our program requires interim care families to provide 24/7 care to a newborn in their home," says Foley. "A baby may remain in care for several days or several weeks." Translation: this isn't a job or a gig — it's your life! Foley tells <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://countryliving.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CountryLiving.com class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">CountryLiving.com</a>&nbsp;that Spence-Chapin volunteers&nbsp;are required to "provide a safe and nurturing family atmosphere of acceptance, kindness, and understanding." In addition to providing each infant with the attention and care that he or she&nbsp;needs to thrive, volunteers are also asked to&nbsp;promote normal development and attachment, document milestones by taking pictures and write&nbsp;down day-to-day&nbsp;observations. Interim care providers must also&nbsp;handle all&nbsp;well-baby visits and medical appointments, and attend Spence-Chapin's required&nbsp;training sessions.&nbsp;(Sometimes birth parents will want to visit the baby, so you'll have to set those meetings up, too.)</p><img alt="Finger, Cheek, Product, Skin, Comfort, Hand, Child, Baby sleeping, Baby & toddler clothing, Nail, " title="Finger, Cheek, Product, Skin, Comfort, Hand, Child, Baby sleeping, Baby & toddler clothing, Nail, " width=2123 height=1416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/16/08/1456170071-gettyimages-542688241.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">&nbsp;5.&nbsp;But not&nbsp;all programs require the baby to live in your home—so do your research&nbsp;to find the&nbsp;right fit for your schedule.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="p2 css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Our [interim care]&nbsp;program is on-site at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cradle.org_about-2Dus_contact-2Dinformation&d=CwMFaQ&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=VINFnRFUMZLN936njQmCb8XXLVzCaD4ul_1HBMGV9TM&m=IfYTRcL3cWMW5Mwg2UV1MO7RA3t2CHsb4-KFhpQJ_Tg&s=J8LVoatOPASRZQZXZAq6a7zsQnERIPw7puM0SVon1d0&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Evanston, class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Evanston,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cradle.org_about-2Dus_contact-2Dinformation&d=CwMFaQ&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=VINFnRFUMZLN936njQmCb8XXLVzCaD4ul_1HBMGV9TM&m=IfYTRcL3cWMW5Mwg2UV1MO7RA3t2CHsb4-KFhpQJ_Tg&s=J8LVoatOPASRZQZXZAq6a7zsQnERIPw7puM0SVon1d0&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Illinois location" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Illinois location</a>," says Joan Jaeger, who handles&nbsp;Outreach and Communications for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cradle.org/about-cradle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=The&nbsp;Cradle class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">The&nbsp;Cradle</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.adoptionlearningpartners.org_&d=CwMFaQ&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=VINFnRFUMZLN936njQmCb8XXLVzCaD4ul_1HBMGV9TM&m=IfYTRcL3cWMW5Mwg2UV1MO7RA3t2CHsb4-KFhpQJ_Tg&s=3c3tpdNTHiQzzSoGmoE_8lbrb_Vpd08G-o7xYKZpddk&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=AdoptionLearningPartners.org class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">AdoptionLearningPartners.org</a>.

"We have a full clinic here where we have pediatricians. We pay for the transportation costs, diapers, even the car seats, as sometimes the volunteer may not have all of the equipment." Take note that this may not be the case with all interim care programs, so ask the agency you choose to work with about any expenses.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">7.&nbsp;Be honest with yourself about the fact&nbsp;that you may become emotionally attached.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="p1 css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Foley says attachment is an expected and natural part of caring for infants. "Volunteers share that they find fulfillment and satisfaction in providing a loving, temporary home for a baby in need — and during a time when biological parents are making one of the most important decisions of their life<strong data-redactor-tag=strong>." </strong>But this is not a foster care program, cautions Foley. "This is not a path to adoptive parenting," she says. "Biological parents retain their legal rights while the baby is in care and are encouraged to visit their baby."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">8.&nbsp;What is a day in the life of an interim caregiver like?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="p1 css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I am not a 'cuddler' and this is not a 'job,'" says Ann Lapin, 39, from Bronx, New York. "I parent these babies 24 hours a day—feeding them, diapering them, swaddling them, taking them to their doctors' visits. I make sure I have enough of the proper formula, bottles and diapers, and correct clothes for the season. We are their parents, and they are members of our families, if only for a few weeks." Lapin wants people considering becoming an interim caregiver to know that this is a family affair, just like bringing your own newborn home from the hospital.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">9.&nbsp;Being an&nbsp;interim caregiver can be incredibly rewarding.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="p1 css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"My favorite part of being an interim boarding care provider is being a part of the permanent story of these families," says Lapin. "From the day the babies are placed in my care, I look forward to the day I hand them to their parents so they can start their lives together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6koJ2rXaWytb%2BOp5ywq1%2BWgHiDj25mraCZo7S0ediorGamlZqxbsDOZqKnp6ditqd52KisZq%2BRo8FuwM5mmZ5lkWLDsLjUp6uenaJitq%2FAxKugpmWTlr%2Bms8ivnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
