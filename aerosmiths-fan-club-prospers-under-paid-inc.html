In the past month Paid, Inc. has processed more than 2,000 memberships for Aerosmith's official fan club, Aero Force One (AF1), which recently re-opened for membership after the fan club transitioned to management by Paid, Inc. Paid, Inc.'s merchandise shipments increased 140% compared to December 2003 with the increased sales from AF1 memberships and merchandise. AF1 merchandise added more than 2,800 packages to Paid's typical December package shipment volume of 2,000 items.</p><p>"The renewal rate for Aero Force One has been fantastic since it re-opened for membership," said Kristen Kuliga, VP for Paid, Inc. Celebrity Services. "Members are renewing in droves, despite the fact that we're offering a free trial membership grace period through February 1, 2005 for past members whose fan club memberships expired in 2004 and for those who dropped their membership prior to Paid taking over the fan club management. In addition to renewing, fans are snapping up the new merchandise items offered in the AF1 online store as fast as it becomes available. As the 120,000 registered Aerosmith fans begin to experience the tremendous programs, exclusive new products and stellar customer service under Paid, Inc.'s management, we believe that these numbers will increase dramatically."</p><p>The new 16-month AF1 2005 Calendar and Aerosmith's new "You Gotta Move" DVD are the hottest selling items in AF1's online store. Since the AF1 storefront opened at Thanksgiving time, Paid has fulfilled more than 2000 merchandise items to AF1 customers.</p><p>The Celebrity Services division of Paid, Inc. is responsible for AF1's promotional programs and web site (http://www.aeroforceone.com/) and integrating fan management services with Aerosmith affiliates, including their record label, radio sponsors, and Internet partners. First-timers and renewing fans can choose from two membership levels, Gold and Platinum. Fans can sign up for Gold membership at $29.99 that includes the annual Aerosmith fan club pin, personalized membership card and a newly added Aerosmith AF1 t-shirt. Or, they can opt for the new Platinum membership at $59.99, an upgrade with all of the Gold perks plus Aerosmith's new "You Gotta Move" DVD and six classic publicity photographs of the band from the Aerosmith archives reproduced for members only. All AF1 members are eligible to participate in an eclectic mix of special promotions, which recently included autographed "You Gotta Move" DVD give-aways, band promotion contests, and more than 600 free passes for the nationwide in-theater event premiering Aerosmith's "You Gotta Move" DVD on November 23 in conjunction with its retail release.</p><p>New fan services and perks are expected to include a redesigned AF1 web site with live chats, message boards, contests, and games, enhanced premium backstage experiences and travel packages; expanded merchandising programs with limited- edition memorabilia that incorporate fan suggestions; and an AF1 Affinity Fan Card that will give fans dollars off at AF1's online store and discounts valid with other vendors. –Bob Grossweiner and Jane Cohen</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiZlae8tLnIrZ%2BsZZaWu26vy66ZZqiipMCxsdGsZK6mlJq%2FbrzAoptmoZ6YfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
