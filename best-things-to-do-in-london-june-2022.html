The exquisite cocktails all pack a punch and are garnished with little extras to mark the occasion - think rose petals, blackberry powder and our personal favourite, a Haribo gummy bear.</p><p id=evEHaXDDc0a6 data-wc=70>If you only treat yourself to one cocktail – though we wholeheartedly recommend trying them all, it's a Bank Holiday! -&nbsp; opt for Long Live The Queen. It's a smokey negroni, which comes presented in a Beauty and The Beast style glass cloche.&nbsp;Your expert cocktail-maker fills the cloche with smoke, which escapes when the glass dome is lifted, for an amazing drink and a wow-worthy spectacle all in one.</p><h3><strong>Enjoy Queen-themed art at ME London</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed774cf12099-jubilee-art-z.jpg><p id=e_JgydMjxM-5 data-wc=22>The ever-impressive <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ME London hotel</a> has installed an art exhibition honouring Her Majesty, with a collection of bold and bright artwork inspired by the Queen.</p><p id=entVFRC5y5z3 data-wc=93>Named 'Queen of Arts' the beautifully curated collection is a far cry from traditional portraits of the Queen. These are punchy, attention-grabbing artworks that delve into different aspects of the Queen's reign. From bold and colourful creations, to unusual and intriguing interpretations of what it means to be the Sovereign in Britain today, the artists have used their own styles to pay tribute to the longest-serving monarch in British history. Loose Women star Andrea McLean snapped one up on her visit to the hotel, so you're in good company if you buy one!</p><p id=eWyF2t-ihdHG data-wc=30>The works of art are displayed on the ground floor of the hotel, in the architecturally-inspiring Marconi Lounge, so post-culture-hit you can indulge in one of the bar's Jubilee cocktails.</p><h3><strong>Enjoy a burger fit for royalty</strong></h3><p id=eKD9O5yQ6_Co><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b88e458688c0-burger-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eMk4ckAT634F data-wc=122>London’s favourite burger hotspot Hachè is set to launch a royally good burger in honour of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee - the Coronation Fried Chicken Burger (£15), available from 1st June- 31st August. The crowning jewel in the burger is the&nbsp;chicken&nbsp;– double dipped in Greek yoghurt and masala spices, tossed in curried flour and tandoori masala coating before being fried until extra crispy and topped with a classic coronation sauce. The&nbsp;chicken&nbsp;is placed on a throne of baby gem lettuce, lime, chilli and coriander, and finished with toasted almonds and a ciabatta or brioche bun crown. Taking inspiration from the dish created for Queen Elizabeth II at her coronation luncheon in 1953, this burger truly is fit for royalty.</p><p id=e8DZDZFG_trX data-wc=3></p><h2 dir=ltr>Best alternative things to do in London in June</h2><h3><strong>Step into the roaring 1920s with The Great Gatsby immersive theatre</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84db39f897a7-immersive-gatsby-z.jpg><p id=ed0yjshlaW22 data-wc=52>The heady glow of the jazz age is brought to life with effortless glamour at The Great Gatsby immersive experience.

Show off your best charleston on the stage as you delight in Daisy Buchanan's scandal, or watch silently from the darkened sidelines with a glass of liquor. As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote himself: "And I like large parties. They’re so intimate.
