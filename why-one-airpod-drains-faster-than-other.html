Hence, much of what you use your AirPods for does influence how long they last.</p><p>So, if you've noticed one of your AirPods draining its battery faster, there's a simple explanation behind it that involves its built-in microphone and software.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever you pull your AirPods out of the case, they automatically choose one unit to serve as the active microphone while the other only functions as a speaker. And this unit that's using the microphone will drain faster.</p><h2 id=how-to-avoid-battery-degradation-on-one-airpod>How to Avoid Battery Degradation on One AirPod</h2><p>Now, over a period of time, if only one specific AirPod gets used as the microphone, it can lead to excessive battery degradation on that unit, resulting in reduced endurance. Fortunately, there's a way to avoid such degradation. It involves periodically changing which AirPod functions as the microphone.</p><p>Once you have your AirPods connected to your iPhone or iPad, follow the steps listed below:</p><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> and tap on your AirPods right below your Apple ID name.</li><li>Now, scroll down and tap on the <strong>Microphone</strong> option.</li><li>Next, choose between the available options: <strong>Automatically</strong><strong>Switch</strong><strong>AirPods</strong>, <strong>Always</strong><strong>Left</strong><strong>AirPod</strong>, or <strong>Always</strong><strong>Right</strong><strong>AirPod</strong>.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/avoid-airpod-battery-drain-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/avoid-airpod-battery-drain-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/avoid-airpod-battery-drain-3.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>While choosing <strong>Automatically</strong><strong>Switch</strong><strong>AirPods </strong>is the most convenient option, if you've started to feel that one AirPod is draining too quickly, use one of the other options. Although this may take away from the magic of the AirPods experience, it will help combat the randomness of long-term wear.</p><p>You can also perform these steps on your MacBook. <a href=#>Connect your AirPods to your Mac</a> , and access <strong>AirPods Settings</strong> by clicking the <strong>AirPods</strong> icon in the macOS menu bar.</p><h2 id=make-your-airpods-last-longer>Make Your AirPods Last Longer</h2><p>Following the steps above will aid a little in ensuring your AirPods don't randomly surprise you with poor battery life. And spreading wear between each unit is the ideal way to help the batteries in your AirPods last longer and save you the trouble of buying a replacement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But don't forget that true wireless earbuds are perishable, so if you don't want to spend too much, consider buying cheaper options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuobFdpLumecCiqamnlGKxs63Ip6pmnpGowaa%2BjK2fmqZdpMGpsdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
