The tweets in question include some wild comments about embattled (and incarcerated) R&B star R. Kelly, a disparaging remark about <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Erykah Badu</a> and the mother of Lil Durk’s child.</p><p>“I wish rkelly was here with me rn,” she wrote in 2017. “I know he would get me right.”</p><p>Granted, the tweet was long before Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly biopic would destroy Kelly’s career, but it was common knowledge he had an affinity for young girls.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Regarding Ms. Badu, JT wrote in 2011, “Erykah Badu Bald head Roxy Miserable Ass Always minding everybody but her own I wanna be down brandy ass BITCH.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pls help me off the floor <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9AFYQGqZch</a></p><p>— BLM isn’t a trend (@wedobeguaping) <a href=#>December 7, 2020</a></p><p>JT also had a few words for Future and his baby-making endeavors.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“At the end of the day, Future got like 1,000 kids to worry about,” she said in 2015. “Fuck Russell [Wilson] and that ‘punk ass hoe.'”</p><p>But it didn’t stop there — she apparently has some issues with Lil Wayne’s daughter Reginae Carter, too. In 2016, she tweeted, “Reginae got me blocked on here from long time ago. I didn’t give that fat corny hoe a break!”</p><p>At one point, she even set her sights on T.I.’s wife and Xscape singer&nbsp; <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Tameka “Tiny” Harris,</a> tweeting in 2012, “T.I. and Tiny relationship is pure. She’s not even pretty but because he loves her make her BEAUTIFUL.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Other controversial sentiments include, “I swear I hate niggas I should be a fucking nazi” and “I wanna get raped by @rkelly.” To say the least, the resurfaced tweets have called JT’s tweeting behavior into question, which led her to start over on a new page under the handle <a href=# rel=noopener>@fuckyallbitches.&nbsp;</a></p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/12/2020-12-3-jt.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Lil Uzi Vert Upgrades JT's G Wagon For City Girls Rapper's 28th Birthday</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 3, 2020</p></a><p>Judging by her Instagram Stories, she’s seemingly taking the criticism all in stride but does want people to stop unearthing the old tweets.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Nah all jokes aside,” she wrote. “stop searching them tweets cause I don’t feel like slapping a bitch back into the same year I was talking about them in.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>jt old tweets wild asl???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DSYgJexgZN</a></p><p>— *rixhrunna??‍♀️® (@omertagoon) <a href=#>December 7, 2020</a></p><p>But as <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>JT</a> confirmed on her (maybe) temporary account, her verified page will return once the inflammatory tweets have been completely scrubbed by whatever poor intern is tasked with the job.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“This page a joke,” she wrote on Monday (December 7). “I’ll be back on my old page very professional once the mass delete is done I might keep this one & put it on private.”&nbsp;</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>This page a joke I’ll be back on my old page very professional once the mass delete is done I might keep this one & put it on private</p><p>— fuckyallbitches (@fuckyallbitch11) <a href=#>December 7, 2020</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZlboFyfo6toK2klWOwqsDYZp6iqpyoerOtz6mcq2WaqXqlscueq56rXZm8rq3Ip5ZvZZaqua15zp9krJuRo7GiuM6uqmaepanCs7GMq2SknZyhxm6%2BxKCgp5mVYrCivtOeqWadoq64orSMm5idrV2pxKax06w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
