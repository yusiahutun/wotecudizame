If you’re unsure of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to watch the Dodgers vs. Padres in Korea</a>, we’ve got you covered so that you can catch Shohei Ohtani’s Dodgers debut, Ha-seong Kim’s homecoming, and more.</p><p>Since 1996, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Major League Baseball (MLB)</a> has played many regular season games outside of the United States and Canada. These types of games were rebranded and renamed in 2023 as the “MLB World Tour.” which, as you might be able to guess from the name, is an effort to spread MLB baseball across the globe. This move was part of the collective bargaining agreement that put an end to the 2021-22 MLB lockout. The league agreed teams could play in additional games outside of the United States and Canada. This includes regular season games in Tokyo, Seoul, Mexico City, London, and Paris between 2023 and 2026.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>For the 2024 Seoul Series between the Dodgers and the Padres, “These two teams are a perfect match,” Jeremiah Yolkut,&nbsp;Major League Baseball’s vice president of global events, told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Athletic</a>&nbsp;ahead of the first MLB regular-season games ever in South Korea. “We just need more and more appetite for baseball in this market both from a live event perspective and wanting us to be here, but also from merchandise sales, business sales, and watching our games on the different platforms.”</p><p>Both the Dodgers and Padres’ rosters are stacked with baseball stars who are sure to put on a show in Seoul.
