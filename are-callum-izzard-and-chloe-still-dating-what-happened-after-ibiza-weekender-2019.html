Young love, eh…</p><p>Of course, no Ibiza Weekender romance is complete without a little bit of drama.</p><p>And, naturally, all Weekender drama centres around Jordan Davies.</p><p>The iconic 26-year-old Ibiza holiday rep went about snaking behind Callum’s back and getting with Chloe, although all was smoothed over within a couple of episodes.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>HELLO THERE:</strong></span></a> Seven things you need to know about Tash – Ibiza Weekender’s bombshell!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-29669 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-07-at-12.43.26.png alt="Screen Shot: Ibiza Weekender series 8" width=708 height=393 sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px">Screen Shot: Ibiza Weekender series 8<h3>Are Callum and Chloe Still Dating?</h3><p>No!</p><p>Chloe responded to Reality Titbit on Instagram to confirm that she and Callum are no-longer dating.</p><p>Their relationship was at its peak around August and September 2018, when Callum was filming for both Ibiza Weekender and Celebs Go Dating.</p><p>Things never progressed seriously outside of Ibiza and they both look happy doing their own things on Insta now.</p><h3>Is Callum engaged?</h3><p>In a seriously strange turn of events, it seemed that Callum was engaged to Love Island star Georgia Steel after just one month of being together.</p><p>While they were said to be madly in love around September 2019, as with many TV star relationships, things have headed south – and quickly.</p><p>It now looks that Callum and Georgia are over as he goes into Ibiza Weekender a single man.
