Ballerini had been wearing a flowing, strapless — almost bridal — white gown, and after her dramatic wardrobe change, she was wearing a short black mini-dress: A swap that reflected the song's message of experiencing and recovering from the emotional separation of a divorce.</p><p>From the camera's perspective, it was almost impossible to tell how Ballerini pulled off the wardrobe swap, though some eagle-eyed fans did peg the white gown as a tearaway dress, since you can see just a little bit of the train being pulled offstage when Ballerini starts to sing again.</p><p>But in a TikTok she shared after the show, Ballerini offered fans a full reveal into how the moment happened, posting video of herself practicing for the stunt.</p><p>Ballerini wears her stage outfit in the clip, barefoot with her hair wrapped up in a towel, and talks herself through the stage directions of the big moment.</p><p>"Dramatic pause. A light goes in front of the camera. And I go ... wait, how do I go? I press it in?" the singer says, reaching over the left side of her dress to test out the tearaway function.</p><p>It's a good thing she practiced, because in her first attempts, Ballerini was a little shaky on the logistics of getting the dress off. But finally, it all works, and she rips the white gown away to reveal the black outfit she's wearing underneath.</p><p>"Telling my future children I was once Houdini," Ballerini&nbsp;jokes in the caption of the video.</p><p>Ballerini was the only country artist to take part in the VMAs this year, unless you're counting <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, who won a whopping nine trophies on Tuesday night (Sept. 12), including major awards like Artist of the Year, Video of the Year and Song of the Year.</p><p>Ballerini also walked the red carpet for the show with her actor boyfriend Chase Stokes.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Kelsea Ballerini & Chase Stokes Sizzle in Matching Red VMAs Looks</h2><p>Kelsea Ballerini and Chase Stokes hit the red carpet at the 2023 VMAs, and they really looked good!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2cqLKiecGao6Wdop67qnnCqKqtrZ2aeqS0wKeenmWfo8C1rcaeZK%2Blkah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
