He expanded on this idea in another interview with Vulture, saying, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You know what they say about being careful what you wish for.</p><p dir=ltr>Because the lyrics are almost eerily perfect for ~these times~, the song has naturally made its way to <a href=#>viral TikToks</a>, which Saxe said initially made him a little uncomfortable, but he soon saw it as a good thing. "As an artist, you hope for cultural relevance with your music, but this is not at all what I imagined or would have ever wanted. So, at first it was a little conflicting to see the song resonating during this time, because it is such a terrifying time for so many. I wasn't sure how to feel about it. But ultimately what I've realized is that the song is making people feel closer to themselves and closer to the people they love because of the emotion that's in the song," he told Billboard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1hbIZ4e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqGWYsGpsYywpquklGLEor%2BMnqWdoZ6ceqPFjKOnZquRrbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
