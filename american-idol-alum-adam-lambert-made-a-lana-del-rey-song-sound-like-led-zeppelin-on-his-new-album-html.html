In the interview, Lambert shared that he really wanted to cover Del Rey’s song “West Coast.”</p><p id=par-3_33>“With ‘West Coast’, it is my favourite Lana song, for sure. I find it very sexy. Being that I am from the West Coast myself, I thought it was appropriate,” he said.</p><p id=par-4_18>Lambert also teased that he made the popular Del Rey song sound quite different than Del Rey’s version.</p><p id=par-5_71>“The idea behind the way we created the track was, I heard the blues guitar in the original and I thought well, if we make that a bit heavier and real electric all of a sudden it almost turns into a sort of Led Zepplin type song and I thought that’d be a really cool flavour to add to the album, something sort of heavy and intense,” Lambert told Wonderland Magazine.</p><p id=par-6_10>Fans can listen to Lambert’s cover of “West Coast” below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-adam-lambert-covered-multiple-songs-on-his-new-album>Adam Lambert covered multiple songs on his new album</h2><p id=par-7_33>High Drama&nbsp;is Lambert’s fifth studio album and it is an album of covers.

I think the response to my cover of ‘Believe’ by Cher at the Kennedy Center was so good, people really seemed to love it,” the singer told the magazine.</p><p id=par-11_42>He continued, “What I did with that was I flipped it from the upbeat dance original to an emotional ballad with strings. So, I wanted to take a similar approach with this album, in taking the songs and changing them up drastically.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-lana-del-rey-released-west-coast-in-2014>Lana Del Rey released ‘West Coast’ in 2014</h2><p id=par-12_36>Del Rey originally released the song “West Coast” on her 2014 album Ultraviolence.
