The shape is also great for anyone looking for a simple, neat-and-tidy manicure.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-square-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Square-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>This shape is created by filing the sides of the nail straight, then turning the file perpendicular towards the tip and filing a straight edge across the top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>Arguably one of the most practical nail shapes, Lin says square nails are ideal for anyone who spends a lot of time typing on a keyboard. "It's easy to maintain, and one of the most common nail shapes for hands and toes," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oval-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Oval-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>"Oval nails are where the sides are filed straight, but the top of the nail is softer with rounded edges towards the ends," explains Lin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>This is another nail shape that will make fingers look longer and more slender. It's also pretty simple to DIY.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-almond-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Almond-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>This shape is inspired by the nut it's named after. "You can achieve this shape by keeping a wide base and then rounding edges towards the top of your finger," says Lin. "The best way to create this look is insuring the narrowest part of your tip line is perfectly aligned with the center of your nail."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>almond nails</a> will elongate your fingers, it's not the most practical shape. Lin cautions that if you do a ton of work with your hands, it's easy to break a nail.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-squoval-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Squoval-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>Squoval nails are similar to a square shape, but with rounder edges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>This is an easy, functional nail shape. "It's common for hands and toenails, not to mention it's used on ingrown toenails," says Lin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stiletto-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stiletto-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>Otherwise known as "pointed nails," this shape works on long nails. To achieve the look, "file sidewalls of the nail straight," says Lin. "You then file the nail up and over from the sidewall to center on both sides."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Who it's for: </b>While this unique shape won't go unnoticed, since the tip is so pointy, it's super easy to break.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-coffin-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Coffin-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>This shape has tapered ends that are squared off. The dramatic look is achieved by filing the edges of the nail toward the center, followed by filing off the tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>Anyone who wants their nails to get some attention at a special event. But on a daily basis, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coffin nails</a> (a.k.a ballerina nails) aren't the most practical shape choice. "If you have weak or short nail beds, I would advise going with a short coffin nail look because it leaves you less exposed for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>nail breaks</a>, but still feels creative," Lin suggests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lipstick-shaped-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lipstick-Shaped Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Definition: </strong>Just like the name of this shape implies, the end is filed so the nail looks like a lipstick bullet. "You create this pointed look by filing your nails in a sharp asymmetrical angle at the tip," says Lin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who it's for: </strong>Lipstick nails are a shape that will elongate your fingers, but it's not an ideal shape for anyone who uses their hands a lot. The bottom line: Save lipstick nails for the next time you're attending a wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZqgpWWjna6xsdJmnq6hlJp6dn%2BYa29yaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
