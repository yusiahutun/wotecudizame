Feek captured audio of the young girl singing one evening recently at their family's farm, as he heard her singing from the shower while he was washing dishes.</p><p>"The song was 'How Great Thou Art,' but the words were more like, 'How Great the World,'" the singer wrote in a <a href=#>blog post</a>. "And I couldn't help but smile as I was rinsing dishes and stop for a minute to capture the moment, so I would never forget it."</p><p>Feek posted the special moment on Instagram, with video that features several evening shots around the house. In the caption of his post, he told fans that singing is a pretty regular occurrence in little Indy's life.</p><p>"Indy loves to sing. She always has...at least, for as long as she has been able to make out words, which has been a pretty good while now," he wrote.</p><p>"She sings in the backseat when we're driving, in her bedroom when she's playing Barbies and pretty much anywhere else, whether people are nearby or not," he continues.</p><p>In his blog post, Feek elaborates on Indy's love of music, saying that she's just as likely to choose subject matter she's heard from her country star parents as she is a kids' song.</p><p>"Sometimes she makes up songs and other times it will be a Disney song like "Let It Go" from Frozen or "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" from Cinderella. More often than not, though, it will be a gospel song," he writes. "A hymn she's heard her Mama or Papa sing, or "Why Me Lord" from Bradley Walker's CD or "The Old Rugged Cross" from a <a href=#>Merle Haggard</a> vinyl album we listen to a lot.</p><p>"But sometimes she does a little of all of it at the same time," he goes on to say. "Sing a gospel song, she made up, with a positive Disney outlook."</p><p>In this case, Indy swapped out "How Great Thou Art" for "How Great the World"&nbsp;— but Feek says there's wisdom in that adjustment to the lyrics.</p><p>"It is a great world, in spite of the hardships and difficulties that we all face at times," he adds. "I'm so blessed and thankful for the joy Indiana brings to mine. I hope the joy in her little heart just keeps growing stronger."</p><p>Indy is Feek's daughter with his late wife Joey. Together, the Feek couple made up country duo Joey and Rory. Joey <a href=#>died of cancer</a> in March 2016 at the age of 40, when Indy was two years old.</p><p><strong>See Joey + Rory's Sweetest Pictures:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6eirnqnscSkZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqCnnKliwKq6xqKloGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
