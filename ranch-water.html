Keep scrolling to learn more about this Texas classic and how to make one at home.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is ranch water?</h2><p>Ranch water is a drink that <a href=# rel=noopener>Ian Blessing</a>, co-founder and owner of <a href=# rel=noopener>All The Bitter</a>, describes as “a tequila and soda with lime.” While ranch water is simple in nature, its fizziness makes it extra special when compared to a standard margarita. “What sets it apart is that the drink is made with <a href=# rel=noopener>Topo Chico</a> — an especially effervescent mineral water bottled just south of Texas in Monterrey, Mexico — and it’s often built directly in the glass bottle,” Blessing says.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did ranch water become popular?</h2><p>Ranch water’s exact history is a mystery. Some believe it was born out of a rancher’s need to quench their thirst after a long journey, while others claim it was created by a restaurant owner. “Legend says that the drink was invented by a rancher in the 1960s in Fort Davis who followed the West Texas stars all the way to Marathon [a town in Texas] on foot and passed out under a piñon tree,” Blessing explains. “Whatever the actual story is, the drink was eventually put on the menu at <a href=# rel=noopener>Ranch 616</a> in Austin in 1998, where the owner Kevin Williamson claimed to have invented it, even applying for a trademark.”</p><p>Despite ranch water’s muddled history, you can find it on bar menus in Texas and across the country. Ranch water is also sold in cans as a ready to drink cocktail. These are a couple of ways to experience the deliciousness of ranch water, but it’s just as easy to channel your <a href=#>inner home bartender</a> and make one in less than five minutes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make ranch water</h2><p>Ranch water is the perfect <a href=#>single-serve cocktail</a> that typically clocks in at 130 calories.
