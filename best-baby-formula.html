There are a ton of brands, and each one claims to be the “best.”’&nbsp;</p><p>So, rather than you feeling overwhelmed, our experts have narrowed down their top recommendations and the tips you need to make the best decision for you and your baby.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">Best formula milk for babies 0-6 months</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/3hfWwo46K6BDybIIi36jzW/dd9e0534c7ba57830f950ac09d1dc352/kendamil_boots.jpg><p><b>Specifications</b></p><p>Don’t just take our word for it that this Kendamil formula is considered the best baby formula for newborns.</p><p>Sarah Clemence, a small business owner with a Bachelor of Science and a mother of four, tells Best Buys, ‘When choosing a baby formula here in the UK, my personal favourite has been Kendamil… [It] offers <b>high nutritional value</b> and has a <b>fantastic reputation for quality</b> and it was a lifesaver when I was juggling my twins' feeding schedules.’</p><p>She also points out that, ‘Kendamil includes <b>full cream nutrients</b>, MFGM, and HMOs, which mirror some of the key components found in breast milk. And best of all, they're palm oil free, which might be <b>beneficial for babies struggling with gas</b>.’</p><p>And though this product is marketed as an infant formula, it does also include feeding instructions for littlies up to 12 months old and can be used to help wean breastfed babies onto formula.</p><p>In other words, once you try it, if you love Kendamil as much as Clemence does, you can stick with it throughout your baby’s first year. No need to go through the trial-and-error process again — a major bonus.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">Best organic baby formula</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/RqFJIh9hTsYnJgWH6sQug/bb3ffd0d09152b91cb7b3b9d8678e16d/Hipp_milk__tesco.jpg><p><b>Specifications</b></p><p>For families who choose to formula feed starting at birth, Hipp Organic Infant Milk offers a great option.&nbsp;</p><p>Clemence tells us, ‘It's <b>gentle</b>, designed for a newborn's delicate digestive system, and is enriched with <b>prebiotics, probiotics</b> and <b>essential fatty acids</b> mimicking those found in breast milk.’</p><p>In other words, this formula is <b>easy to digest</b> for infants, and parents can rest assured that it’s made with completely <b>organic ingredients</b> and nutrients that will help their little ones grow healthy and strong.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">Best formula for breastfed babies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/6HgAiTCCDvXRJWzJiW7XKW/7631594e4eb721f118497b61978e3660/aptamil_tesco.jpg><p><b>Specifications</b></p><p>‘The transition from breast to bottle can be a tricky time,’ Clemence admits. She recommends a gradual approach and adds that ‘Aptamil Profutura [now Advancced] was my go-to during this [transitional] period.’</p><p>Dr James Walker, a clinical doctor with over 10 years of experience, tells Best Buys that these transitional, ‘follow-on’ or ‘stage two’ formulas ‘are designed to support the nutritional needs of infants aged six months and older.’</p><p>Aptamil Advanced 2 formula includes nutrients, vitamins and minerals such as <b>milk fat; vitamins A, B2, C and D; DHA</b> (also known as Omega-3); <b>calcium</b> and <b>iron</b> to help your growing baby as they develop.</p><p>Note that this formula is <b>only suitable for babies older than six months</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>As Dr Walker reminds us, ‘the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life.’&nbsp;</p><p>But, if you are opting to use formula instead of breastfeeding before your baby reaches six months, <b>make sure to use an infant formula</b> instead of a follow-on option for your baby’s optimal growth and development.</p><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">Best formula for babies with cow’s milk protein allergy&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/4wsmwPO6x4l4GI3b6kzWRW/46021ccff909216efb2ad3c79bf58395/nutramigen_chemist_direct.jpg><p><b>Specifications</b></p><p>If you have an <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">extra fussy baby with digestive or skin problems</a>, they may have a cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA). This is <b>different to being lactose intolerant</b>, which means that lactose-free baby formulas won’t necessarily help.</p><p>With a lactose intolerance — more common in adults than children — the body can’t digest lactose. But with a CMPA — more common in babies — <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">the body’s immune system targets certain proteins in milk</a>.</p><p>Nutramigen is a specially designed formula that can be used to safely feed babies with CMPAs right from birth.&nbsp;</p><p>Even better, the formula contains certain peptides and gut-friendly bacteria that can <b>help babies eventually overcome their CMPA</b> as well as <b>reduce the risk of further allergies.</b></p><p>However, Kropf cautions ‘<b>Always consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect an intolerance or allergy</b> — they're the best resource in such cases.</p><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">What’s in baby formula?</h2><p>You probably want to know what’s going into your baby’s tummy when you give them a bottle of formula, right?</p><p>Kropf tells us, ‘All infant formulas are <b>required to meet certain nutritional standards and contain identical core ingredients</b>, which is reassuring.’</p><p>In other words, no matter which store-bought formula you choose, they should all be generally safe and healthy to feed your baby.</p><p>You can read more about these requirements on the UK <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7atn">government site</a> if you’re interested.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/1EIaSezvGe8mjFghWEVijR/cd5dbf9991883b11be2ee09f0990efe5/mother_feeding_baby_pexels_Sarah_CHai.jpg><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">What should you look for when choosing a formula?</h2><p>‘From my experience, there's no definitive 'best' [formula], as it heavily depends on the individual baby's needs and reactions. What works for one person may not work for another — and that's okay!’ Kropf explains. ‘It's not about “the best” but rather what suits [your] baby best. If your baby is generally happy and growing well, then the formula is doing its job!</p><p>But of course, you want to give your baby the best nutrition possible.</p><p>To this end, Dr Walker lists the following factors to consider when choosing a baby formula:</p><ul readability=6><li readability=-1><p><b>Age appropriateness:</b> ‘Ensure that the formula is suitable for your baby's age.’</p></li><li readability=5><p><b>Nutritional content:</b> ‘Look for formulas that contain essential nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals’ — including DHA ‘which is crucial for brain development and is one of the few additives that has proven benefits’ adds Kropf.</p></li><li readability=2><p><b>Special dietary needs:</b> ‘If your baby has specific dietary needs, such as lactose intolerance or cow's milk allergy, consider specialised formulas designed for those conditions.’</p></li><li readability=0><p><b>Safety and regulations: </b>‘Choose formulas from reputable brands that meet regulatory standards and have a good safety track record.’</p></li></ul><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">What ingredients help with gassy babies?</h3><p>Clemence gets straight to the point: ‘Let's face it, no one likes a gassy baby, right? So you'll be glad to know certain ingredients can help. Formula <b>without palm oil</b> or <b>enriched with probiotics and prebiotics</b> can be beneficial, as they can aid digestion.’</p><p>Dr Walker adds that ‘Some formulas are formulated to be easier to digest and may contain specific ingredients to help with gas and fussiness in babies, such as partially <b>hydrolyzed proteins or added probiotics</b>. However, individual responses can vary, so it's essential to <b>monitor your baby's reaction</b> and <b>consult with a healthcare professional </b>if necessary.’</p><p>But ultimately, Kropf points out that ‘while the market offers various formulas like those for colic, reflux, and hunger, the <b>evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited</b>. So always look for what works best for your baby.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/best-buys/images/6M43VTr2gYH76qxrbSsycf/bb9591ba36405c971723237c3eb9d5ef/Dad_with_baby_Unsplash_Mikael_Stenberg.jpg><h3 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus3 _1kgw0810">Which is the closest formula to breast milk?</h3><p>‘No formula can truly claim to be the “closest to breast milk,”’ Kropf admits. ‘Breast milk composition is a remarkable and complex natural process that changes over time and varies from mother to mother. And while formulas contain many nutrients in breast milk, it's worth noting that <b>breast milk contains over 100 substances not found in formula</b>.’</p><p>But Dr Walker adds that ‘While no formula can<i> exactly </i>replicate the composition of breast milk, <b>some formulas are designed to be as similar as possible</b>. These are <b>often referred to as "infant formulas"</b> and contain a blend of proteins (such as whey and casein), carbohydrates (such as lactose or a combination of lactose and other sugars), and fats.’</p><h2 class="_1eyelus0 _1eyelus2 _1kgw0810">So, which baby formula should you choose?</h2><p>There are so many formula options available for all different stages of growth.</p><p>As Clemence recommends, <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>Kendamil</a> is a great option for infants all the way up to one year old, while <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>Aptamil</a> is great for transitioning from breastfeeding and <a href=# class="_19lp7ath _19lp7atr _19lp7ato u7les91 u7les92" role=button rel=sponsored>Nutramigen</a> offers a solution for babies with CMPA.</p><p>But ultimately, the choice of which baby formula is best is yours.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch and listen to your little one, speak to your paediatrician and use your new parental intuition to make the best decision for your baby and your family.</p><p><b>Did you like this article?
