It’s the style we opt for when we need a little more than a pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans</a> but less than a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>skirt</a>. Not to mention, there’s an undeniable element of edginess that comes with wearing leather, so naturally, we went on a mission to pick the best ones. In an effort to provide an affordable shopping selection (a pair of genuine leather pants will most often run you over $1,000), we went the vegan route and found the best faux leather pants that are both polished and cool.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Today's Best Deals</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As you'll see below, faux leather pants are offered in a variety of styles, colors, finishes, and rises to enhance their appeal. In terms of appearance, it's come a long way, too, looking more and more like the real thing with every season that passes. Now, it's easier than ever to enjoy the cool girl look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-aritzia-wilfred-melina-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aritzia Wilfred Melina Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritzia Wilfred Melina Pant Vegan Leather pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X3SG7_yUiLdid-woG-1OjUv9bFY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-melina-pant-high-waisted-vegan-leather-pants-9fba70c229c04cdd99cec943f5b2af43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The finish is buttery soft and smooth and doesn’t have a sticky feel.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sizing runs a bit small, so you may want to size up for a roomier fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re obsessed with the Melina Pant (like me), then you know the vegan leather alternative will be just as good even before trying it. When I slipped these pants on (which were kindly gifted from the brand), I would have never guessed leather, or in this case, vegan leather, would fit my three requirements in bottoms: extremely comfortable, stretchy, and breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aritzia is stylist Ashleigh Ashton's favorite place to shop for faux leather pants, too. "It’s like they know my body because their leather pants fit like a glove, and they always offer an array of styles ranging from high rise fit with a flare to a straight leg and low rise," she tells InStyle. Aritzia’s innovative vegan leather not only feels like the real thing but looks like it as well. With these pants, you will not have to worry about a pleather-like appearance or an annoying squeaky sound as you walk. The only foreseeable trouble is choosing a color from the 20+ options available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, straight |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyurethane exterior and polyester interior | <strong>Size: </strong>00–16 in short, regular, and tall | <strong>Colors: </strong>21</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-makemechic-faux-leather-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MakeMeChic Faux Leather Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MakeMeChic Faux Leather Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K0uNEIv8zK8v_lutBY99VIQ6I1g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MakeMeChic-Faux-Leather-Pants-4f62eec07d4f44c0bf9a22752b3f20c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> They’re very stretchy, which makes for a great fit on thick thighs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> They might be short on tall people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may recognize these pants from their viral moment on TikTok. According to the reviews, these live up to the hype. They’re stretchy, comfortable, and flattering around the middle. Some even pointed out that if you have thick thighs, the impressively stretchy fabric hugs them in the most pleasant way — basically, they fit properly without constricting movement. However, our tall friends might find the hem too short for their liking (unless they’re going for a cropped look). If you lean on the petite side (according to the reviews, 5 feet, 4 inches looks to be the cut-off), you’ll find these lightweight pants a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, straight |<strong> Material: </strong>Viscose, polyamide, spandex | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-the-frankie-shop-bonnie-croc-effect-faux-leather-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Frankie Shop Bonnie Croc-Effect Faux Leather Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Frankie Shop Bonnie Croc-Effect Faux Leather Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hKHJcGDS8VijBh64PMSnNGnssRc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-frankie-shop--bonnie-croc-effect-faux-leather-pants--4b640c770de348738d59069cf22d30e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Moda Operandi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The print, although faux, looks impossibly real.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can only be dry-cleaned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This croc-effect option adds some fun texture to your look. Luckily, no animals were harmed for this statement piece, but the design looks impossibly real and high-end. While the print is unique, the high-rise fit and relaxed straight leg is a style that’s been loved for decades and can easily be styled up or down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, relaxed straight<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, polyester, cotton | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slim-afrm-heston-straight-leg></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slim</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AFRM Straight Leg</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AFRM Heston Straight Leg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EXjG61cpTxFENRp5kiCweUKZwEc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AFRM-Heston-Straight-Leg-bc94b5706f424f5496ff91499ee221f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AFRM</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Not only are the pant’s incredibly soft, its silhouette is flattering on everyone.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They fit bigger around the waist, so reviewers suggest sizing down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">AFRM's Heston Straight Leg truly hits at all the right places. Reviews have called these pants one of the most “flattering” and “comfortable” pair of faux leather pants they’ve tried, even considering them the best on the market. Not only are the pants super soft, they’re designed to lengthen and enhance your silhouette thanks to their five pocket styling.

(Okay, except maybe <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>knee-high boots</a>.) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sneakers</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>ankle boots</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>heels</a> all seem to look more stylish when under the graze of cropped pants, as demonstrated by this piece from Mango. The straight leg adds to its relaxed appeal, giving you an effortlessly chic and put-together piece. We of course adore that it comes in a wide size range, offering plus-size options up to size 22 as well. What we don’t love, however, is the fact that it’s an online-exclusive piece, so you won’t be able to try it on at the store before committing to your purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, straight cropped<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane | <strong>Size: </strong>1–22<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-abercrombie--fitch-vegan-leather-90s-straight-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Vegan Leather 90s Straight Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Vegan Leather 90s Straight Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5MhsMkc-qyXDgRc3UMcwYsXzwuM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie--Fitch-Vegan-Leather-90s-Straight-Pants-eb1540674b6b4398a77de3bfb57fc605.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> No matter your height, these pants will fit you at just the right length.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Not everyone will love the ultra high-rise waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing I love about Abercrombie’s sizing is that it comes in multiple lengths. These pants are available in extra short, short, regular, and long, so you never have to worry about the legs of the pants dragging or rising above the ankle. They feel and look super luxe, and are ultra high rise all the way up to the waist (but still manage to flatter my body) for a true '90s fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>Ultra high-rise, straight | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane coating, polyester, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>23–37 in four lengths | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-good-american-good-legs-cropped-mini-boot-faux-leather-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Legs Cropped Mini Boot Faux Leather Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Legs Cropped Mini Boot Faux Leather Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wxqSAyjL5qzVa86NWeWB0_WXkSw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american--good-legs-cropped-mini-boot-faux-leather-pants-11f9490124604033a06c53d99f1678e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They curve around your figure without gaping at the waist.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There isn't a selection of inseams.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can always count on Good American to produce quality, cute, and inclusive clothing that can be enjoyed by all. Take these cropped leather pants, for example. Curving around your figure in the most flattering way, the pants were cut in a way that accentuate your behind without gaping at the waist.

As pull-on pants, they’re relatively easy to slip into with no fuss. For this reason, there’s plenty of stretch in the pants that makes them curve around your legs and backside a little better. On top of coming in a wide range of sizes, you can choose between petite, regular, and tall inseam lengths. In other words, it’s going to be easier to find your perfect size match here. They’re fitted throughout the pants except at the heel, where they have a slight flare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, flare<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X in petite, regular, and tall<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-rise-apparis-trey-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid-Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Apparis Trey Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Apparis Trey Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Cyqm8xzEz6qnMQekxMJXJGLX6uM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Apparis-Trey-Pants-aa2593470ef54e9fb721b8a75aaeb448.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Apparis</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The elasticated waistband and relaxed fit of these pants make them effortlessly polished.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We wish there were more stand-out design elements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Faux leather pants with an elastic waistband? We couldn’t ask for a better pair. Because of its comfy waistband, these pants can easily be dressed up or down, especially with their relaxed leg that fits loosely all around. They’re an Apparis staple for a reason, and will most likely be one of yours, too. We just wish they had a few more standout details for the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>Mid-rise, relaxed<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, viscose | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-red-naked-wardrobe-faux-the-love-of-bootcut-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Red</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Naked Wardrobe Faux The Love of Bootcut Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Naked Wardrobe Faux The Love of Bootcut Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/T_DMU6TTlT2fpgSyzD75cCIbgDM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/naked-wardrobe--faux-the-love-of-bootcut-pants--fcae0a71367e4d7a91d502c68194abdb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s enough spandex in them to make them stretch comfortably over your legs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They may be too long for petite women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If it weren’t for Michael Jackson’s Thriller, the idea of wearing bright red leather pants might not jump to the top of your mind. However, the icon made the fashion statement into what it is today — and even decades later, we’re still looking for new ways to sport the flashy pants. These pants are pull-on, but don’t worry, there’s a decent amount of spandex sewn into the material to make them stretch over your legs and butt. They fit pretty snugly throughout the legs but drape loosely at the opening at the bottom. With a 34-inch inseam, the length might be a touch awkward on those who are petite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-waist, bootcut| <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, spandex, rayon<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong><br>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-commando-faux-patent-leather-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Faux Patent Leather Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Faux Patent Leather Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QFR0IzEMlFAsvHa2jv9Rr_GPg48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Commando-Faux-Patent-Leather-Pants-a497db33f3de4d40b1055c51f4d0f6e1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The glossy finish sets these apart from your usual leather pants.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> You can only hand wash these pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For something a little more glossy, try the trending liquid leather pants. With a bit of a “wet” effect to them, the fabric — a blend of viscose, polyurethane, nylon, and elastane — looks both stretchy and sturdy all at once. They crop just above the ankle in a slim fit, so it will be easy to pair them with some high heels. They’re also more form-fitting than some of the previous pairs we’ve included, which combined with the texture, makes them perfect for nights out in town. You must avoid machine washing them at all costs, though, or the glossy texture might get ruined — but hand washing every so often isn’t too bad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, straight | <strong>Material: </strong>Viscose, polyurethane,&nbsp; nylon, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-cult-naked-killa-trousers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cult Naked Killa Trousers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cult Naked Killa Trousers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L9gdAH9wO0NvSQJTotXGvFBDq4Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cult-Naked-Killa-Trousers-8ca61fded7fd44209050aff41235a010.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cult Naked</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made for taller women to wear with heels.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The seams can be a little irritating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The number of celebrities who have worn and loved these pants is quite impressive. Everyone from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Ariana Grande</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Normani</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Kendall Jenner</a> (who has it in black and brown) have been spotted strutting around in the Cult Naked Killa trousers, and for good reason: they’re perfectly high-waisted and ridiculously comfortable. The best part? They’re made for our long-legged ladies. (The description after all says they’re “long enough for tall girls to walk in heels.”) Bianca Kratky, who is a co-author of this story and stands 5 feet, 8 inches tall, wanted to put this claim to the test and tried on the Killa trousers herself. Sure enough, they’re extremely flattering with her 8-inch heels. Even with sneakers, they bunch up naturally and don’t drag on the floor. That being said, she found that the seam around the thigh can feel a little irritating after some time. Also, women with a little more booty might find these pants a little restricting around their bottoms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise, straight | <strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester, polyurethane | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re not going to pretend that black isn’t the most versatile <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>capsule wardrobe</a> staple.

It’s usually made from polyurethane (PU) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The former is the more durable option of the two and shouldn’t crack and peel over time. To us, the higher price point for polyurethane-based faux leather is worth it for pants that will last longer and require less maintenance.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit and rise</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Searching for our desired fit in pants comes with trial and error. With many styles to choose from, ranging from straight to bootcut to skinny, the right pair will flatter your figure, compliment your wardrobe, and provide enough comfort to wear throughout the day. But depending on your style preferences, some fits will offer you more or less room than others. Just as you would expect, relaxed pants are roomier around the waist and thigh, whereas slim pants are slimmer around the legs, but are not necessarily skinny. A boyfriend style, on the other hand, is much baggier in style than a relaxed pant, yet offers a straight design throughout the legs. You will also have to take into account the rise, as most pants are available in a low-rise, high-rise, super high-rise, and/or classic rise. If you want to have a safe and standard option, digital creator Sansha Coetzee recommends “high-waisted straight leg pants that crop at the ankle, because it’s the most flattering and versatile in terms of styling with shoes, like loafers, ballet flats, sneakers, heels, and ankle boots.” She also adds that this style won’t fall out of style and will remain a staple for decades to come.

Like genuine leather, faux leather requires extra care, so when you clean your pants, it is best to place them inside a machine-washable bag to prevent any damage. Another alternative to washing your faux leather pants is using a delicate, non-abrasive cloth dipped in water and a gentle soap to wipe over your pants. For both methods, allow your faux leather pants to hang dry or lay them flat to help maintain their shape and quality – never place faux leather in the dryer.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do faux leather pants stretch?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quality faux leather will fit snugly, never tight. But if you prefer a bit of stretch in your pants, there’s good news: faux leather will gradually stretch over time, especially in areas like the waist, knees, and legs. To quicken the process, fabric softener and warm water can always be used.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style faux leather pants?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All the stylists we interviewed agreed on one thing: faux leather pants are extremely versatile. Ashton claims there are “endless ways to style faux leather pants, but one of my favorites for this fall is faux leather with a nice thick oversized cardigan with cute patent leather boots.” Coetzee chimes in that you can wear everything from “casual sneakers with a chunky sweater to kitten heels and an off-shoulder top for date night.” Meanwhile, wardrobe stylist Karlita Sutela recommends pairing them with pieces that “will totally oppose the smooth and embossed look and texture of leather pants — think rugged and edgy.” It’s true, we’ve found that there’s about nothing these pants can’t pull off. While jeans may be reserved for more casual outings, leather pants can be styled for the office just as well as for brunch.
