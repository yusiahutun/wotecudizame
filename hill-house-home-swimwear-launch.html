Like the first launch, it's a tight edit: just a few one-piece and two-piece silhouettes in florals, solids, and gingham.</p><img alt="two models wear hill house home floral swimsuits while sitting on sand dunes to illustrate a news story about hill house home launching swimwear" title="Hill House Home Launches Swimwear 2022" width=1002 height=665 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1403-2-r-1652191815.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Claiborne Swanson Frank</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A trifecta of the limited drop's technical details overlap with other recent swimwear launches: Every suit is made from a recycled material called Econyl, which features UPF 50+ sun protection and is chlorine-stain resistant. The feminine ruffle details and full-coverage fits come entirely from Diamond's needs as a mother of three, as a counterpoint to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g10018511/new-swimwear-brands/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="string bikinis" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">string bikinis</a> and '90s-rise one-pieces dominating the market.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was looking for a bathing suit that felt really fun and flattering and pretty," Diamond tells BAZAAR.com, "but also felt modest enough that I could chase after my three kids in it. I'm such a mood-based dresser. I really want to acknowledge, especially after three kids, some days I wake up and want to wear something really revealing, while other days I'm like, 'Nope, I want to be more covered up.'"</p><img alt="a model and a child model stand on a beach wearing hill house home apparel to illustrate a story about hill house home launching swimwear 2022" title="Hill House Home Launches Swimwear 2022" width=1000 height=1501 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0738-2-2-r-1652191894.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Claiborne Swanson Frank</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This being Hill House Home, ruffles and florals were also necessities.

After shoppers flocked to a pond floral print released on dresses this spring, Diamond knew it needed to come back in swimwear.</p><img alt="a group of models wear hill house home swimsuits while sitting on the beach to illustrate a news story about hill house home launching swimwear" title="Hill House Home Launches Swimwear 2022" width=1001 height=608 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0427-2-r-1652191970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Claiborne Swanson Frank</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More swimsuits are imminent in the brand's larger summer collection, due out in June. The slow and steady introduction reflects Diamond's larger vision for post-Nap Dress products: They're few, feminine, and highly considered. "It's been a huge question on our minds the past two years: Where do we go next? I think it's a very important point for us that we don't create things that we think already exist in their perfect form," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These swimsuits near Diamond's definition of summer perfection. She tells me she sent her spring break samples back to the manufacturer without a single note to improve or adjust the fit. "I felt incredibly confident in this swimwear," Diamond says, "which is something I can't say I've felt in a very long time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shop the entire collection online at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/new-arrivals data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=hillhousehome.com data-vars-ga-product-id=627ed80b-8698-48cf-bd65-b67cb11aa074 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/new-arrivals data-product-url=https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/new-arrivals data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillhousehome.com%2Fcollections%2Fnew-arrivals" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$150.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=94d58e1c-91b9-45ea-acd6-db5e194e2463 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">hillhousehome.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
