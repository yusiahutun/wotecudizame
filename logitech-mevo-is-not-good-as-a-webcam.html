A lot of people like this camera, but <a href=#>not everyone</a>. What‚Äôs good about it:</p><ul><li>High-quality 4k output with nice bokeh and such</li><li>Much smaller. Easier to mount and deal with.</li></ul><p>Bad stuff:</p><ul><li>It‚Äôs got USB out, but it‚Äôs not super reliable. Better to use the HDMI out and a <a href=#>Camlink</a> (way smoother video), but that means I‚Äôm back to <strong>two cables</strong> out of the camera.</li><li>The USB still has to be there to charge the battery, it‚Äôs <strong>not</strong> a battery passthrough. This means the battery degrades over time, and will randomly shut off during usage. I‚Äôm on battery #2 after about 6 months, but battery #2 (third party) isn‚Äôt behaving well already.</li><li>Looks designed to be a point-and-shoot camera, not really a webcam.</li></ul><p>With the battery issues on the ZV-1, I was inspired to see if I could find something better. There seems to be <a href=#>a new-generation of webcams coming out</a>, but the <a href=#>Mevo</a> was ready to buy already, so I went for that. I find Logitech to be a pretty good brand and the website for it was pretty convincing.</p><p>The main thing for me: <strong>one cable</strong>. Just one USB-C cable out of it and to computer, that would be great.</p><p>Unfortunately, even just setting it up kinda sucked. It doesn‚Äôt just show up as a webcam, you have to be running special software.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-10-at-2.28.35-PM.png><p>Notice it says ‚ÄúWired Webcam Mode‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt realize this, but using a cable to connect the camera is a ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù feature, and the only way to turn that on is to also install an app on your phone to connect to the camera and turn it on there. So two software installs just to use the camera as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù webcam. I would have maybe been OK with that, except check the quality compared to the ZV-1.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-10-at-1.55.30-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-10-at-1.57.23-PM.png><p>I‚Äôm sure the Mevo has some nice uses. It‚Äôs definitely marketed toward sort of lower-budget multi-camera out-in-the-world shooting, and perhaps it‚Äôs great for that. But it‚Äôs just not good enough to a webcam, especially at the $400 pricetag.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ü§ò</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpa2dganxyfI6lpqChpJqwqXnMnq2oZZmoeq%2B702aeqKeUYq60ecBmrp6ak5a6cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
