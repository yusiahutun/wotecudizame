One is a six-bedroom house on three acres in Stafford, Virginia, and the other is the Russian Embassy in Washington.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Diplomatic records show that Smolenkov worked as a “second secretary” in the embassy from at least 2006 until 2008. He appears to have received a traffic citation in 2006 in Arlington, Virginia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Senior Russian diplomats would be coveted spies for the United States. And Smolenkov rose through the Russian diplomatic ranks after his tour in Washington.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He worked for Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov, who has been at Putin’s side for years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ushakov served as his foreign policy adviser when Putin became prime minister in 2008 and stayed with him when Putin became president in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/11/cad5fdc2-d448-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_132116.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He’s as close to Putin as you can get with respect to foreign policy matters and especially the United States,” said Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow who knew Ushakov well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was ambassador for 10 years in Washington. So he’s highly regarded as their country’s expert on America,” and is in every meeting Putin has with a head of state, McFaul said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is not clear that Smolenkov is the source who provided the United States with details on Russia’s election interference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he was almost certainly a valuable CIA asset, according to current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The CIA declined to comment, but it denied CNN’s report that a Russian informant was exfiltrated out of fears that Trump himself might expose him.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">US extracted top spy from Russia ‘because Donald Trump couldn’t be trusted with information after meeting Russians’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday angrily denounced reports detailing the secret exfiltration saying they were “materially inaccurate”.</p>Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, confirmed Smolenkov had worked for the Kremlin but <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">played down his importance</span></a>, insisting he was a low-level employee who had been fired two years ago.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Current and former officials said the asset who informed on Putin worked for the CIA for more than 10 years and was taken out of Russia around May or June of 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward wrote in his 2018 book Fear that the CIA felt its source “was in such jeopardy” that the agency wanted to move the person to another country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The source refused to leave, apparently out of fear of repercussions against the person’s family if the source suddenly left Russia or disappeared,” Woodward wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A neighbour who lives across the street from the Smolenkovs said that the family had moved into the neighbourhood earlier this year. He said Oleg, his wife and children left on Monday evening and hadn’t returned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/11/dc3817b2-d443-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_132116.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When a Post reporter went to the house Tuesday morning, it appeared unoccupied, save for two black cane corsos, an Italian dog breed sometimes trained as guards. Thick drapes were drawn across the windows on the house’s lower level.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The family seems to have left in a hurry. Behind the house, toys and clothing were strewn about the yard. A woman’s sweatshirt lay draped over a patio chair. A full ashtray and two lighters were on the patio table.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One neighbour, who asked not to be identified, said Smolenkov didn’t have a job. After moving in earlier this year, Smolenkov said he looked forward to tending the house’s ample lawn and gardens, the neighbour said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Donald Trump’s spy chief pick John Ratcliffe is attempt to ‘neutralise’ US intelligence agencies, ex-officials warn</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He said he had a lot of time on his hands,” the neighbour said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was no answer at a phone number listed for Smolenkov.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Intelligence experts were baffled that reporters were able to so quickly glean information about a potentially high-level CIA asset.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joseph Augustyn, a former senior CIA officer who ran the agency’s National Resettlement Operations Centre from 1991 to 2001, said it “boggles my mind” that Smolenkov would be living in the United States under his real name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/11/f9e0647c-d443-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_132116.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That said,” he added, “we respect the wishes of the particular defector”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can see him saying: ‘Well, I want to live as normal a life as possible. I don’t want to assume a new name, make it difficult on my wife and kids’,” Augustyn said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s not what the agency would recommend.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another former senior CIA official said the agency discourages defectors from using their real names or living near the nation’s capital, where Russian intelligence services have an extensive presence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In most cases, “you come up with a completely new identity and legend, and you want to get the guy out to Colorado” or somewhere similarly outside the Beltway, said the former official, who handled numerous defectors and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss CIA procedures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There have been exceptions, typically in cases when the United States and Russia have swapped spies – trading operatives who had been caught engaged in espionage with the tacit understanding that they would not be targeted after the transaction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is no known evidence of such an arrangement in this case. If a swap occurred in Montenegro – where the suspected spy supposedly disappeared in 2017 – the cover story of a family disappearance might have been concocted by the Kremlin to obscure the departure of a former official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/11/39b9d290-d44e-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_132116.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Former senior intelligence officials said that Putin doubtless knew that Kommersant, the Russian newspaper, was publishing Smolenkov’s name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Why do that?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If I’m speculating,” McFaul said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is obviously to intimidate him and scare him.”</p>Russia has a long history of targeting former spies and dissidents abroad, most recently last year when operatives tried to assassinate kill former Russian intelligence officer <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sergei Skripal</span></a> in England, using a deadly nerve agent.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far, Moscow has not carried out killings in the United States.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Augustyn said there are “several hundred” defectors now living in the United States, coming from countries such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At the CIA, our responsibility is to our asset,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our responsibility is to make sure that they remain safe, and when it looks like it’s time to bring somebody out, we’ll do it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by The Guardian and Agence France-Presse</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Suspected Russian spy for CIA hiding in plain sight</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZIBxfpVvbnFno6rAsbHCrZydZaKqwLS1wKdknKGRYq60v8StZKGhlGKzornIpbBmqJyWtq950qKeoaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
