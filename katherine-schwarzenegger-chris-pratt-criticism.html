Critics took it as a slight against Pratt's ex Anna Faris and their son, who faced health problems as a baby after he was born nine weeks premature, leaving him with some physical limitations, including visual impairments.</p><p>"I see what people say," Schwarzenegger told The New York Times.

They became engaged the following January, and two tied the knot in June 2019. The couple shares two daughters: Lyla, 2, and Eloise, 8 months.</p><p>Schwarzenegger and Pratt are known to be relatively private about their personal life, which is something the former said she learned from her parents.</p><p>"I know this sounds crazy, but I really would love to just do exactly what they did," Schwarzenegger said. "I look back on how much of life my parents kept private, and I have a lot of respect for it."</p><p>She added, "I think they kept a lot of their relationship private, they kept us kids private -- you know, they didn't take us to red carpets, they didn't have us parading around in front of everybody."</p><p>Schwarzenegger is the oldest child of Maria Shiver and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former couple -- who split in 2011 after 25 years of marriage -- had three other children: Christina, 31, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/patrickschwarzenegger>Patrick</a>, 29, and Christopher, 25.</p><a id=gallery-link-bdb3aae0-dbb4-484f-b261-ad7548d58d9b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bdb3aae0-dbb4-484f-b261-ad7548d58d9b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:38e1732b-d2f5-43bf-afa6-94f22708d2d5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/4by3/2023/02/06/6786ee9740d6453ab2ce6bce26b1405a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaW9foK61tMSroKedXaiwqcPAq7GeppWctKa%2BjJyfq6GjYr2zrdOtZJyqmam2pLXSpmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
