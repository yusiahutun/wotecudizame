She is the owner of Fang restaurant in San Francisco, an eatery that puts modern twits on classic Chinese dishes. Growing up, food was a big part of Kathy’s life as she mostly spent her time at her father Peter Fang’s restaurant, House of Nanking, where he was also the head chef.</p><p>The new Food Network show, Chef Dynasty: House of Fang, which premiered on December 27, 2022, takes a look at the workings of the Fang restaurant and Kathy’s relationship with her father. Find out about Kathy’s net worth, age, family, and personal life, in the wiki article below.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kathy Fang Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Kathy Fang’s net worth was around $5 million.</p><p>Given that Kathy spent most of her life at the House of Nanking, it should be no surprise that she chose San Francisco when it came to opening her own restaurant in 2007.</p><p>Most of the Food Network programs are shot in New York City. However, since Kathy’s restaurant is located across the country in another culinary capital of the States, Chef Dynasty: House of Fang broke the mold by becoming one of the few Food Network shows to be shot in other place than New York City.</p><p>On Kathy’s restaurant’s website, she described cooking as “a family affair.” When Kathy’s parents opened the restaurant, she was only 7 and since her parents could not afford daycare, Kathy spent all of her waking hours in the restaurant. “That was basically my home, I would spend all day, even on a school night I would be there until midnight,” the reality TV star once said.</p><p>It was during that time that Kathy fell in love with food. Even at a young age, she had a habit of breaking down a dish, which later helped her define herself as a chef.</p><p>There’s no doubt that much of Fang’s cooking is dictated by her upbringing. Her food also seemed to be much influenced by her dad’s creativity.</p><p>With Chef Dynasty: House of Fang, Kathy hopes that the viewers will learn a thing or two about the inner workings of a Chinese food restaurant, especially one that’s in San Francisco.</p><p>As per Nob Hill Gazette, Chef Dynasty: House of Fang was filmed over the spring and summer of 2022. Kathy told the outlet that her favorite moments of filming in San Francisco took place mainly in Chinatown, an area which she referred to as her childhood in a nutshell.</p><p>Food Network star further said, “It’s where my family’s restaurant was born. I was literally born in Chinatown, at the Chinese Hospital, and this is the place where I fell in love with food and cooking.”</p><p>Kathy, who is a two-time champion of the hit Food Network competition show “Chopped”, was a bit skeptical when she was first approached by Food Network for Chef Dynasty: House of Fang. However, when she saw all the pieces come together, she was excited for all the people to see her work.</p><p>Before appearing on Chef Dynasty: House of Fang, she also appeared on shows like Alex vs. America, Beat Bobby Flay, and Guy’s Grocery Games. Furthermore, she is also the author of Easy Asian Cookbook.</p><p>Kathy has done undergraduate studies in Entrepreneurship at the University of Southern California and graduate studies in Business, Operations Management, and Entrepreneurship from the University of Southern California – Marshall School of Business.</p><h3><strong>Kathy Fang Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1982, Kathy Fang’s age was 40 at the time of this writing in Dec 2022.</p><h3><strong>Kathy Fang Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Kathy’s <a href=#>family</a>, her parents are Peter and Lily Fang.

After a failed attempt at proposing during their trip to Paris, Caleb tried again in San Francisco and this time sought the help of one of &nbsp;Kathy’s favorite chefs, Chef Gary Danko, to help him prepare a faux holiday party.</p><p>Almost immediately after arriving at the party, Kathy realized the event was not a typical party. Eventually, the tech guy revealed that the event was a ploy to ask Kathy to marry him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kathy-Fang1-273x300.png><p>Soon after their engagement, Kathy and Caleb got married.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Does Kathy Fang Have?</strong></h3><p>In 2017, they gave birth to their first child, Ava.
