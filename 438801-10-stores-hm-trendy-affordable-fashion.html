However, that does not mean there are no cheap and yet trendy clothes, and this is thanks to stores like H&M. It is all about knowing the right places to do your shopping, and you may be surprised to find similar products that are cheap in some stores and expensive in others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3412e62784a15b6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best stores like Hot Topic for those who love alternative fashion</span></p></a><h2>10 best stores like H&M</h2><p class=align-left>Brands like H&M have taken over the clothing industry because they provide their clients with trendy and affordable fashion. Most such stores are also convenient because they have an online presence; hence shoppers can make orders without leaving their homes. These stores include:</p><h3>1. Express</h3><p class=align-left>Express is an H&M alternative that is quite affordable. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Express</a> has hundreds of stores in the USA, but it also caters to customers through shipping from other parts of the <a href=#>world</a>. The selling point of this brand is its trendy and unique designs making its collection to be on-demand.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish? Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.</strong></p><p class=align-left>Express may not have as many categories as H&M, but reliability and affordability easily make up for that. Clients can shop for unisex clothing materials, swimwear, intimate wear and footwear, among other things. In addition, free shipping and returns are provided on jeans from Express.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2584b1fd78564cc8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best websites like DHgate for importing items from China in 2021</span></p></a><h3>2. Uniqlo</h3><p class=align-left>Quality is always guaranteed when you shop at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Uniqlo </a>because it has devoted resources to research fabric materials. However, a smaller brand in the fashion world, the company has claimed a stake through the high number of orders it continues to get from customers. Apart from the unique Uniqlo products, some popular <a href=#>brands</a> can also be bought at their stores.</p><p class=align-left>The Uniqlo sunscreen that uses cutting UV technology is the range of products that attract customers to the brand. These men's t-shirts rely on dry-ex technology, ultra-light jackets, and the AIRism underwear collection. The choices are diverse, targeting men, women, and children.</p><h3>3. Zara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3412e62784a15b6.jpg><p class=align-left>Zara is among the most popular brands like h and m with a presence globally. The products found in H&M can also be found in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zara </a>stores at almost similar prices. The best part about Zara is that the store releases its collections at fast speeds. This means Zara's sales are more aggressive, and their products are competitive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dff15a375ea29787.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 most expensive makeup brands in the world in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Products offered by this store are usually divided into sections for women, men, kids, <a href=#>shoes</a>, and bags. However, there is something for everyone, and other things such as accessories are also sold. The downside is that products don’t last long in Zara stores. This means you have to check online and see if a product is available before going to the store.</p><h3>4. Borderfree</h3><p class=align-left>The idea behind the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Borderfree </a>brand is to have a store that makes worldwide shopping look local.

This makes it a good H&M alternative for cheap and unique fashion.</p><p class=align-left>Borderfree ships its products to more than 220 countries. Clients can shop for all leading brands like Veronica Maine, Harvey Nicholas, Tony Bianco, Aquilia, and Pepe Jeans through their website. In addition, there are various categories to shop for, including men's apparel, baby and kids, activewear, bridal, handbags and shoes, among others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0cff054b8cff0718.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Container houses in Kenya: A complete guide</span></p></a><h3>5.

To ensure accessibility, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Topshop </a>has more than 500 shops worldwide. Their prices are relatively reasonable, and the international shipping option makes them more preferred by customers.</p><p class=align-left>The company prides itself in clothing, bags, <a href=#>beauty</a> products, footwear and other accessories.

One of the things people like about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reformation</a> is its floral patterns and light summer fabrics. These provide the range of clothing people can wear all year round regardless of season and place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/487a54ec0148fd83.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Lady Cosmetics branches location and contacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The simple boho-inspired designs that Reformation has come to be known for having taken the world by storm hence exploding the company's popularity.

Charlotte Russe</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Charlotte Russe</a> is a company based in the USA.
