We usually go in mid-July, but we pushed it to the beginning of August this year. I was nervous that it might be a bit cooler than usual during the evenings; while the temperature stayed around the mid-to-high 80s during the day, the chill of the evening air was enough to have me covered in goosebumps.

I like wearing this on travel days or when I want to look cute but don't want to put in the effort of picking out an outfit. It's great for the daytime, and when it starts to cool down, it easily layers with my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell Conway Mixed Stripe Pullover</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">maxi dress</a> in classic gray, but it also comes in 12 other colors, such as black, white, and pink.

It also makes for a great styling moment by draping over your shoulders. And when fall rolls around, I can change from pairing it with shorts and over dresses to jeans and trousers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The striped sweater comes in sizes XXS through XXL, and while I bought a size up for a more slouchy look, the sweater already fits a bit oversized.

These jeans were perfect for our breezy boardwalk trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Available in sizes 23 through 32, these Levi's come in several light and dark washes and are made with a heavier-weight denim that will convert perfectly for fall and winter. Plus, they have a bit of stretch, so they hug the body without being too tight. They're also high-waisted and have a classic straight fit that stops right at the ankle. You can shop them for as low as $37 at Amazon, depending on your size and shade preferences.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-levis-wedgie-icon-fit-high-waist-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Levi's Wedgie Icon Fit High Waist Jeans</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essentials Strappy Slide Flat Sandal</a> has been my go-to slip-on sandal all summer. They come in pink, purple, light beige, and brown and are available in sizes 5 through 15, including wide and half sizes. It features soft faux leather criss-cross straps, a rubber outer sole with great traction, and a cushioned inner sole so plush you'll want to walk in them all day. (The only downside is they do leave wicked tan lines.)&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amazon-essentials-strappy-slide-flat-sandal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Amazon Essentials Strappy Slide Flat Sandal</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re taking a last-minute trip or starting to think about transitional dressing, these picks are perfect to add to your cart.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YnKBdq66krdOipqdllajAprrTopilq12asarAzqtkqaGToMBug5VtamxwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
