His father gave him the nickname Bocephus after Grand Ole Opry comedian Rod Brasfield's ventriloquist dummy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/949713be83a49f93.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Jason Gould's partner?

Williams has a half-brother named Jett Williams. During his childhood, several contemporary musicians, including Jerry Lee Lewis, Merle Haggard, Fats Domino, Johnny Cash, Earl Scruggs, and Lightnin' Hopkins, frequented his home and taught him various music instruments and styles.</p><p class=align-left>He was a student at the John Overton High School in Nashville, Tennessee. While there, he participated in music events, including taking his guitar to <a href=#>music class</a> and playing for pep rallies. He was also active in the performances of the choir.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84946096fd8f30ef.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>In his early career days, from around the age of 8, Williams followed in his famed father's footsteps and used to cover his father's songs and imitated his style. He toured with his mother performing his father's biggest hits and made his first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry when he was 11.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b8a9f03374ae9a7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Michael Mando's partner? Sexuality and dating history</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His first television appearance was in a 1964 episode of <i>The Jimmy Dean Show</i> on ABC, where he sang his father's songs. Although his recordings of his father's songs had earned him a reputation as the "Hank Williams impersonator," Williams became disillusioned and cut ties with his mother.</p><p class=align-left>He started recording songs different from his father's, but he had also gotten into drug and alcohol abuse and attempted sui*cide.</p><h2>A change in musical direction</h2><p class=align-left>After the failed suic*ide attempt, he moved to Alabama and started creating music with southern <a href=#>rock musicians</a> like Toy Caldwell, Charlie Daniels, and Waylon Jennings. The album <i>Hank Williams Jr. and Friends</i> (1975), in which he had collaborated with these musicians, became his breakthrough.</p><p class=align-left>In August 1975, Williams nearly died after a mountain-climbing accident in southwestern Montana. As he was climbing Ajax Peak, the snow beneath him collapsed, and he fell almost 500 feet and suffered multiple skull and facial fractures.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b77c99ce8cc0b939.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Dylan Macdonald?

The accident is chronicled in his semi-autobiographical film<i> Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story</i>. It took him two years to recover, and he once again returned to music, but he first had to learn to talk and sing again.</p><p class=align-left>Williams hit his peak partly thanks to his new voice and remained prolific throughout the 1980s into the 90s. Between 1979 and 1992, he released a total of 21 albums, and all were certified gold by the RIAA.</p><p class=align-left>He is well known for his hit <i>All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight</i>, which became the theme song for<i> Monday Night <a href=#>Football</a></i>. His opening themes for<i> Monday Night Football</i> in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994 earned him four Emmy Awards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d2387f71bba23dc7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Heard: 7 things you never knew about Amber Heard's father</span></p></a><h2>Wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>Hank Williams Jr.'s partner was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gwen Yeargain</a>, but they parted ways in 1977.
