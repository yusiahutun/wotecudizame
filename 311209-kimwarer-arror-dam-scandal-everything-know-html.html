The amount was used to pay contractors an advance payment before the project could commence.</p><p class=align-left>Noordin Haji indicated that there was no evidence that the land where the project was to take place had been acquired by the government. He further cited that this was a “well-choreographed scheme” by top government officials in collision with private institutions and individuals.</p><p class=align-left>A case file seen by Citizen TV revealed how the money was shared among the involved individuals and companies for supplying goods and services for the project.

The source stated that the following plotted ways were used to defraud the dams funds:</p><ul><li>The National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) gave a nod to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The activity provided a go-ahead to the two projects. Surprisingly, there is no evidence that the exercise was carried out. Additionally, the body ignored protests from other agencies not to approve Kimwarer and Arror dams initiative.</li><li>The National Treasury released Ksh 643 million to compensate and resettle people in the areas affected by the move. There is no evidence that there the land was acquired by the government.</li><li>Kenya Forest Service insisted that excision of forest land to build dams was not a good idea. However, despite that, top officials continued with the projects plans.</li><li>The Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) circumvented the tendering process to ensure CMC di Ravenna Company was awarded a contract. To do so, officials in authority used the 2005’s Public Procurement and Disposal Act for concession.</li><li>CMC di Ravenna was awarded a contract while clearly, it was facing a voluntary liquidation in Italy.</li><li>It is alleged that KVDA didn’t allow competition from suppliers for all the tenders.</li><li>It was stated that all the contracts would cost Ksh. 46 billion. However, the National Treasury negotiated an increase in the loan to 63 billion shillings. It means that there was an additional Ksh. 17 billion.</li><li>CMC di Ravenna is said to have submitted technical design drafts on February 2019. It was four years behind the scheduled time.</li><li>The Kenya National Treasury entered into a loan contract in Euros. This is even though commercial agreements are supposed to be in US dollars, thus causing losses in exchange rates.</li><li>Ksh. 11 billion is alleged to be paid as upfront for insurance, yet the government guarantee would have at no cost sufficed.</li><li>Another Sh. 4.6 billion was borrowed by the authorities in addition to the other loan to settle the interest in advance. It means that a loan was acquired and later another added to pay the benefit of the first debt.</li><li>Borrowed money went direct to personal bank accounts an indication that no one was overseeing their use.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d6183508bb62736c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Living Large: Ahmednasir Abdullahi, 4 Leading Kenyan Lawyers Who Own Stunning Mansions</span></p></a><h2>DCI interrogates top leaders</h2><p class=align-left>Following the scandal revelation, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) summoned over 100 directors to his offices for questioning.

He stated that his office had the evidence proving that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ksh. 19,714,366,911 </a>was lost through a well-planned scheme.
