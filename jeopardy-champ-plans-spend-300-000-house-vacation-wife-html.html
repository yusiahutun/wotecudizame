It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.'</span><br></p><p><span>'I quickly found stories about former champions like Roger Craig and David Madden and Chuck Forrest who've bucked the tradition of starting at the top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success in the game.'</span></p><p><span>'There's no logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next clue is going to be, you gain a major advantage over them.
