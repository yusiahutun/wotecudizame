We’d covered ultramarathon distances by kayak for days on end and spent an equal amount of time trapped in our tent by storms. My feet still sting with cold and the doctor says I should expect full sensation to return in a matter of months – I last felt my toes on July 2.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We were the first people to kayak the fabled route, and the first to do it under human power, in any craft, in a single year. These were world firsts, sought after by the adventure community for at least a decade – even this year there were two other rowing teams attempting the same feat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/25/e0cf5af0-aa83-4207-a7fa-75cf73e3c76b_0676a378.jpg>The Northwest Passage is the Arctic route that links the Atlantic to the Pacific, most famous for the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">doomed John Franklin expedition</span></a> – all the crew lost their lives when their boats were trapped by ice.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Martin Frobisher first searched for the passage in the 1570s and it took almost 300 years before it was finally found by John Rae in the 1850s. It took another 50 years for Roald Amundsen to be the first person to make it through. As the ice retreats because of climate change, adventurers have been dreaming of becoming the first to make it through by human power, with no sails or motors.</p>I am so proud. I am so content. I got everything I was looking for from this expedition. But what strikes me, is that what I was looking for changed dramatically. I first started this column in 2020, and I look back on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">that article and cringe</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I called the Northwest Passage by human power the “last great first” and concluded that because the ice was retreating “history beckons for one final effort for the centre stage of the age of exploration, 100 years after everyone thought it was over”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/25/13f078be-cac5-4687-9d06-fa0457ddecdd_b1edbba9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the time I started, my motivations were routed in more than just gaining a world record or two. I was determined to have an immersive experience in nature and to build deep bonds with my teammates – Americans Eileen Visser, West Hansen and Jeff Wueste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I frequently gives talks to schools, companies and other audiences, and this is part of the journey I always emphasise – do not focus on a single outcome, you need intrinsic motivations too, which allow you to judge success on your own terms. The journey would not have been the same if the only thing I wanted was my name in the record books.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I got the immersive experience I was looking for. In fact, at times it was maybe too immersive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/25/50866151-c2d4-4217-80be-29515f45b7ab_5c60d7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On one occasion, after paddling for almost 11 hours, sea ice floated in from another part of the passage. It filled every inch of the water around us. It flowed and spilled over itself like lava. Although we were less than four miles from shore, a distance that would usually take an hour, it took us eight hours to reach land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We frantically paddled back and forth looking for an opening. We eventually found a break in the ice, not big enough to get to land but big enough for a rest. As we bobbed around, contemplating our predicament, two massive bits of ice changed direction and started to close in around us.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeff and West managed to paddle out of harms way but Eileen and I were stuck. With a sickening crunch the ice collided. It should have crushed us to death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By some miracle, the pressure lifted us, like squeezing a bar of soap that slides up out of your hand. We popped out on top of the two bits of ice, pulled ourselves forward and plunged back into the water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/25/8197db23-6946-49ed-a7dd-ae11fdcaeba6_5c60d7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the danger wasn’t over. The little space that remained was closing too. I leapt out onto a flat bit of ice, hauled our kayak onto it, then grabbed the other kayak just as West and Jeff were being capsized by the moving ice and hauled them up too.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We sat on our new floating home and waited until enough space reappeared and we made a mad dash for shore. We’d been kayaking for 18 hours.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Challenging as it was, it was the most memorable and enjoyable day of the expedition. It was just one of many tough days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So when we finally finished the passage on October 8, I cried and cried and cried, and then had to paddle another 16 miles to a campsite, wait out another storm, dig our tent out from under the snow in the pitch dark and kayak a final 32 miles to an abandoned airstrip to get picked up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The world firsts we’d achieved felt monumental, but they were just one of the outcomes I sought. The experiences we had, and more importantly the experiences we shared, will live with me forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWeRp8Gqr8ueZmxqY259eoOOn6Crq6RiwaatzGaimrGRoHqivsKtoJyrXaO8s8DHsJysrF2lrrS%2FwKCcZp6Zo7G0ecyoqZ5lmqrAtXnWqKmlnF2nsqS70Z2qZpmemXqvwcybZJ%2Bdlal6przInA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
