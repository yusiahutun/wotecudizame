That's literally all we say to each other each week."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She added,</p><p>"In the back of my mind, I'm always going to wonder where I fell short with him. I don't know if he'll ever be okay with like telling me what it was."</p><p>Nicole then concluded, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Even though we're not together anymore and I'm open to dating, I feel like the way he goes out of his way to hurt me will affect me for years."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"Sometimes I just feel like I will never f--king heal from that s--t.

He makes me laugh. His sense of humor is hilarious. I'm open to see where it's going. I'm not putting too much pressure on what it is at all but it's fun."</p><p>Hencha shared her finding of&nbsp;Dockett from Metisha as,</p><p>"I told&nbsp;Metisha, 'Darnell is finally dating someone that she really likes, his name is Darnell Dockett. She was like, ‘Hencha, that is somebody I used to smash.'"&nbsp;</p><p>Talk about unlucky!</p><p>Regardless, the trained dancer&nbsp;and model is happy with where her life with her daughter as evident in one of her Instagram posts shared back in July 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, she has written a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> for 'People' magazine regarding her experience on co-parenting and urged her followers to read it via an Instagram post in September 2017, and the picture she shared apparently shows the fantastic hairdo of her daughter,&nbsp;Carson Cree.</p><p>Safe to say that this lady, who is American by nationality and reportedly&nbsp;African-American by ethnicity, is pure inspiration to all the single moms out there!</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Keep visiting</a> for the emerging updates on the life of Darnell Nicole!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZp2ZoqOyrbiMp6Ccp5yaeqKzxGaZqLGWp7amusNmmaudkaB6tryMmp2fmZmnerGt0Z6lratdna6qvoynmK2hn6OurbXTsmSerJijtqS107JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
