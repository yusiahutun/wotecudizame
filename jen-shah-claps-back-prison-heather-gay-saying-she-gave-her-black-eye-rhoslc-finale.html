Andy Cohen has weighed in after Shah called him out in her Instagram post about Gay's claim.
During Wednesday's episode of his SiriusXM radio show, Andy Cohen Live!, the Watch What Happens Live reacted to Shah's remarks, first sharing that he believed the timing of her comments is &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I just need to predicate that I'm a current victim of fraud, which is what she is in jail for. I'm not connecting her, I'm not saying that she's responsible for it, but I'm just saying it's ironic."</p><p>Cohen then called out Shah's claim that the alleged encounter between herself and Gay didn't happen because there isn't footage, echoing thoughts he shared during the Season 3 reunion.</p><p>"I don't want to be captain obvious here, but if we had footage, don't you think we would've aired it?" he said. "Heather's saying, 'I don't know how I got the black eye,' and then don't you think we would've cut to the footage with a chyron that said, 'Four hours earlier?'"</p><p>The Bravo star also reacted to Shah's comment that Cohen was "still butt hurt" she "turned down" his request to do an interview with her.</p><p>"I had forgotten about the one-on-one with Jen," he said. "She is right, I did want to do a one-on-one with her. I don't care about it anymore. I'm over it. Her stipulations were insane."</p><p>"She wanted us to do a docuseries of her days leading up to jail," he added. "She wanted a lot of money, and she was still professing her innocence, so it would've been another interview of her sitting across from me lying to my face, which we got at two reunions from her, so that's that."</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">Original story below</p><p>It was a wild, bombshell-filled season finale for <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</strong></a>, and the shots kept coming even after the episode aired. One shot came all the way from Bryan Federal Prison Camp in Texas, where former cast member <a href=#><strong>Jen Shah</strong></a> is serving six-and-a-half years.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives</strong></a> alum quickly jumped onto her <a href=#><strong>Instagram Stories</strong></a> from the minimum security facility after the finale aired Tuesday night to shoot down one claim by <a href=#><strong>Heather Gay</strong></a> -- who surprisingly changed her answer to one of last season's biggest questions.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:94be4c6b-e63d-4c9c-9e31-3461ad79b60f data-container-ref=toofab:article:e56c0c64-fef2-4c2f-b073-3e1f7ca3d9ae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e7/5by4/2023/01/25/e798e88babad40089fcec6cee9172e2b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Andy Cohen Grills Heather Gay on Mysterious Black Eye and Jen Shah's Potential Involvement</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While trying to explain why she and the women were reacting so strongly after a bombshell revelation destroyed one cast member's relationships with everyone -- you can get all of those hot deets <a href=#><strong>here</strong></a>! -- Gay reversed course, now saying it was Shah who gave her that infamous black eye.</p><p>If you'll recall, Gay had previously denied Shah gave her the shiner last season ... or at least she said she didn't know. She held firm then, even under a grilling by <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> during the reunion shows, claiming she was "blacked out" and didn't know what happened.</p><p>"There was an investigation that didn't find anything," Cohen added at the time, "and there was no additional footage, by the way, or else it would have been shown."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/o/2024/01/03/b97fee7f33914249b1e9eadad1ddf4c8_md.jpg width=825 height=631 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Bravo/Instagram</span><p>Shah is clapping back at both Gay's new claims that she was the cause of the black eye, as well as Cohen. "If I punched Heather in her eye, you guys would have footage to prove it," she posted to her IG Stories.</p><p>Of course, producers and camera people would love to be able to capture every single moment with these reality stars, but that's obviously impossible. Nevertheless, Shah was adamant this moment would have been captured.</p><p>She went on to clap at the show itself, which she's been absent from this entire season. "It's clear the show can't live without me since I was brought up at the beginning, middle and end of Season 4," she wrote.</p><p>Cohen was her next target, as she added, "Andy is still butt hurt that I turned down his 1:1 interview. Why would you sit down with someone who 'gave' another cast member a black eye? Next story."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0befa8fa-2dfe-4c88-9971-e3c66b2cfd58 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e56c0c64-fef2-4c2f-b073-3e1f7ca3d9ae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/24/5by4/2023/01/20/2494180bf8dd4b719f3a76ba0535eae3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jen Shah Reveals Why She Won't Do Interview with Andy Cohen</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She punctuated her post with a graphic of herself blowing a kiss and then lips themselves.</p><p>Earlier this year, the reality star was given 78 months -- or about 6.5 years -- for her role in a nationwide telemarketing scheme. Shah and assistant Stuart Smith were accused of generating and selling "lead lists" of innocent people who could be targeted as part of a telemarketing scam for almost a decade. Many of the victims were elderly and working class.</p><p>As part of her sentencing, she was also ordered to forfeit $6,500,000, 30 luxury items, and 78 counterfeit luxury items, and to pay $6,645,251 in restitution.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b47b7c72-05e7-41bf-85f2-16f775ec8ccb data-container-ref=toofab:article:e56c0c64-fef2-4c2f-b073-3e1f7ca3d9ae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/5by4/2023/07/06/d95439e302c44c0cbdba7f46e2891aac_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jen Shah Says She's Tutoring and Teaching Pilates Behind Bars, Vows to 'Make My Victims Whole'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In an update from prison this past July, Shah is acknowledging her wrongdoing.
