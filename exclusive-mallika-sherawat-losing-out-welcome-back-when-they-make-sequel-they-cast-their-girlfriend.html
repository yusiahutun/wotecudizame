A sequel to Welcome was also released in 2015, however, Mallika wasn’t a part of it. Now, in a recent conversation with Pinkvilla, when we asked the actress about a possibility of another sequel in the franchise, here’s what she said. “Welcome ka sequel banega toh director apni girlfriend ko hi dalega na usmein. Welcome 2 bana toh usmein apni girlfriend ko daal diya batao, ab main kya karun? (If a sequel of Welcome is made, then the director will only cast his girlfriend. When Welcome 2 was made, he cast his girlfriend in the film. What do I do now?),” questions Mallika.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The actress states that she wouldn’t like to take any names. “But this is true. When they make a sequel they cast their girlfriend, the hero casts his girlfriend, what do I do then? I don’t have any boyfriend in Bollywood, I have never been with any actor, director or producer. With me like this is my work, if you think I am worthy of your project I would love to be a part of it. But if a director, or a producer or an actor - if they want to cast their girlfriends then it's their choice,” she adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Is this the reason why you lost out on Welcome 2? “Absolutely. What should I do? That is the only reason I lost out,” informs Mallika.
