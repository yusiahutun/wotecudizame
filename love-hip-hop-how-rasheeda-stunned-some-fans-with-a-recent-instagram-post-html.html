However, the connection would be made easily by fans of the show.</p><p id=par-4_30>The caption of the picture wished her grandson Kayden a happy birthday, saying, “Happy birthday to my handsome, intelligent, amazing grandson&nbsp;#Kayden&nbsp;I love you!!! wish my baby a happy birthday guys!!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_18>Some fans began to comment in surprise, saying they did not know that she was a grandmother.</p><p id=par-6_9>“Didn’t you was a glam mama,” commented one fan.</p><p id=par-7_6>Another commented, “Grandsonnnn!!
