Surely, the mastermind behind all of Jesse's troubles will also be making a triumphant return in some capacity (no spoilers here!), though this is clearly a Jesse-centric project.</p><p>Cranston has previously confirmed the project was in the works but would maddeningly never say if he was or wasn't going to be a part of it. Our money is on him showing up, though.</p><p>We also know that Jesse's long-time friend Skinny Pete (Charles Baker) is back in the fold, as the first teaser focuses entirely on the inept stooge being interrogated about the disappearance of a certain fugitive.</p><p>The titular El Camino was last seen with Jesse behind the wheel making his escape from his captors, so it's safe to say the authorities won't be the only ones looking for him.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:30126aea-4066-5ee5-988e-f6dc22c1c284 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9f471d5f-4e5c-5f56-87dd-21db565f74d2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9d/5by4/2019/08/09/9d045eff7398556eac78bb19e3ddf236_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab/Netflix</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'GLOW' Star Sydelle Noel Cops to 'Stalking' Geena Davis on Set (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>It's not completely clear if the film will take place entirely in the immediate aftermath of his escape, or if it will take a jump into the future. The series did, after all, go off the air six years ago.</p><p>In an interview with <strong><a href=#>The New York Times</a></strong>, Paul said, "It's a chapter of Breaking Bad that I didn't realize that I wanted. And now that I have it, I'm so happy that it's here." He did not, of course, go into any more specifics about what the chapter entails or even when it takes place exactly.</p><p>The actor also confirmed Odenkirk's assertion that the film was completed, saying they did it under the guise of an indie film called "Greenbrier."</p><p>"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" is written and directed by Vince Gilligan. Starring Aaron Paul and Charles Baker (plus many more, we're sure), it hits Netflix on Friday, October 11.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
