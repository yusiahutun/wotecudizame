Check out our <a href=#>product research & curation process</a><p>When you constantly expose your skin to the harsh UV rays without any sunscreen, your skin cells are at the risk of getting damaged which could ultimately result in skin cancer. So, having the best SPF 100 sunscreen for your face in your daily skincare routine is highly recommended. We all know that our sun provides us with the necessary nutrients for us to be healthy, but it also emits UV rays which are very harmful. Our findings show that people with extremely sensitive skin and people who spend a lot of time outdoors are at a greater risk of getting affected by it. The heat from the sun absorbs all the moisture from your body, leaving a dry skin and a high chance of getting a sunburn or black spots. So, using it on a daily basis lets your skin retain its natural moisture and stay healthy. Some of them even also act as an anti-aging lotion owing to their antioxidant ingredients which helps in retaining your skin’s youthfulness.</p><p>According to a board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rina Allawh, “Damage from UVA/UVB exposure is cumulative throughout one’s lifetime and may increase skin cancer risk. I recommend broad spectrum SPF 100 sunscreens to help provide incremental protection vs. a low SPF number for those with skin prone to burning”. Some people might not see the damages done by these harsh rays, but after a few years, they show up unannounced which makes them difficult to treat.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>What Does the SPF 100 Sunscreen do?</h2></p><p>Sunscreen provides your skin with a physical layer of protection that absorbs the harmful UV rays and prevents your skin cells from damaging and from issues like from sunburn and tanning. The SPF level in sunscreen is a measurement to gauge how much of the UV rays will be absorbed or reflected away from your skin. Which means, a sunscreen SPF 100 will ward off upto 99.9% of the harmful rays whereas the lower SPF are effective only against 97%.</p><p>If you’re reading this article, it means you couldn’t decide which sunscreen to buy and we completely understand you. There is a wide range of brands that you get to choose from but you need only the best ones. So, our team of researchers have put together a list of the 7 best SPF 100 sunscreen that you can buy right now.</p><p><h2 class=title>7 Best SPF 100 Sunscreens</h2></p><p>Made specially for the sport enthusiasts, this spray sunscreen with SPF 100 from Banana Boat is effective against 99.9% of UVA and UVB rays(<a href=#><u>1</u></a>).

After that, we’ll tell you all the benefits of using SPF 100 sunscreen.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose a Sunscreen With SPF 100?</h2></p><p><strong>Skin type:</strong> Before you try any product that goes on your body, it is absolutely necessary to understand if your skin is sensitive or not. If you have a product that has a strong formula and is not skin-friendly, your skin could have bad allergic reactions. So, sunscreen like La Roche-Posay SPF 100 provides adequate protection for all skin types.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> You need to be on the lookout for ingredients that are harmful in general like oxybenzone, octinoxate, or alcohol which does more damage than good for your skin. But active ingredients like extracts from fruits, leaves, and other natural substances are a great source of antioxidant benefits to delay any early aging signs.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Try and choose a formula that retains your freedom of movement when applied. A formula that is smooth and light does not dry up quickly and does not feel heavy when applied. Using a formula that dries up quickly might also prove to be difficult in washing them off. Something like Banana Boat Sport Ultra SPF 100 is a great choice for that.</p><p><strong>Water-resistance:</strong> If you are going to spend a lot of time in water, then you should choose water-resistant sunscreens. Usually, sunscreens allow water-resistance for upto 80 minutes. If you need longer protection, you’ll need to reapply the sunscreen.</p><p><h2 class=title>Benefits of SPF 100 Sunscreen</h2></p><p>Studies have proven that SPF 100 sunscreen is far more efficient and provides a superior level of protection against sunburn and other skin diseases(<a href=#><u>3</u></a>). Where SPF 30 or 50 protects only 97% of the harmful rays, SPF 100 protects against 99.9%. People who have extremely sensitive skin usually can reap the complete benefits of SPF 100. It prevents sunburns and delays aging signs like fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>Considering the harsh environment that we live in today, skin care is the most fundamental practice that everyone should follow. If all these years you’ve ignored using sunscreen, it is high time to make a habit of using it even if you are busy. It is the only way to keep your skin protected and hydrated from everything around us. So, let your skin breathe easily and experience the best of both worlds - protection from the harmful rays and retain a youthful skin. Go ahead and choose the best SPF 100 sunscreen that you like the most.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Ollie Wertheim, Founder and Chief Formulator, <a href=#>Senstive Skin LLC.</a></p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Does 100 SPF sunscreen work on sensitive skin?</p><p>Yes, 100 SPF sunscreens are effective on sensitive skins.
