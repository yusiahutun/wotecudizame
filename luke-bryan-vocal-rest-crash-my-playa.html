The singer is on vocal rest ahead of four played shows at Crash My Playa next week.</p><p>On Instagram, Bryan's wife <a href=#>Caroline Bryan</a> shared a photo that shows her putting painter's tape over her husband's mouth. His sad eyes&nbsp;contradict his "rock on" hand gesture. Bryan is on vocal rest after "his EXCESSIVE screaming at National Championship game," Caroline writes. "Can't say I'm too unhappy about it."</p><p>Nope, not a lot of sympathy from Bryan's better half of 15 years. See for yourself:</p><p>There's no indication that his upcoming performances will be affected.&nbsp;"I plan on talking nonstop and annoying the hell out of him," Caroline adds.</p><p>Technically, Bryan is only slated to perform during two of four nights at<a href=#> Crash My Playa</a>, but he's kept a strong presence each day in years past, as it is his event. <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> and <a href=#>Dustin Lynch</a> will headline the other nights, with additional artists like <a href=#>Lainey Wilson</a>, <a href=#>Jimmie Allen</a> and <a href=#>Ashley McBryde</a> filling out the sold-out festival.</p><p>Three weeks after Crash My Playa, Luke Bryan's Las Vegas residency at Resorts World begins, with shows scheduled through Feb. 26. He has not announced a summer tour, but is signed up to headline several festivals.</p><p>Bryan has not weighed in on his vocal issues on his own social media page. His team did win, however, as the Georgia Bulldogs beat the University of Alabama 33-18 to&nbsp;take their first championship title in 42 years.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Jason Aldean's Spectacular Florida Beach House</h2><a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>'s beach house in Santa Rosa, Fla., sits right on the Gulf of Mexico.<p>Aldean paid $4.1 million for the new 5-bedroom, 5-bathroom, 4,452-square-foot beach house. The spectacular property affords the singer and his family the opportunity to walk out their back door and down a bridge to their own private beach, and the exterior of the villa features a courtyard with iron gates that includes gas lanterns, a swimming pool and a fountain.</p><p>The home's interior includes a downstairs with an open floorplan and oversized windows, chiseled stone floors, a gourmet kitchen, a bedroom and study and a fireplace, with coffered ceilings throughout. The upstairs of the home includes two separate master bedrooms that both overlook the Gulf, as well as two more bedrooms that each have their own attached bathrooms.</p><p>The stunning home is also set for whatever weather might blow in from the Gulf. Built in 2005, the house features all-impact windows and doors, as well as Geo-Thermal heating and cooling, cellulose insulation, foam ceiling and floor insulation and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqjvtiapWaun5iurXnRnqqtZZOnrrS0jKawZqiclsaiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
