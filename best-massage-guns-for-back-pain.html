Why do these tools suddenly seem to be everywhere and on everyone’s holiday wish list? Well, one of the best ways to find relief for back pain is to head to the spa for a massage, but between the pandemic and the prohibitive cost, that’s not an option for many people right now.</p><p>If you’re wondering, “Do massage guns help back pain?” the answer is yes, they definitely do! We spoke to Molly Palmer, a former ballet dancer who suffers from <a href=#>chronic back pain</a>, and she said the first time she tried a massage therapy gun it was the best thing she ever felt in her whole life.</p><p>That might be why massage therapy guns are suddenly the hot “must-have” item flying off shelves (both virtual and in-store). But what are the best massage guns for back pain, and how do you know which one is right for you?</p><p>We’ve rounded up 11 options, with choices for every budget — and below, we answer some of the most common questions about these tools, many of which can ease your pain for less than the cost of one professional massage.</p>Read More<h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do I choose a massage gun?</h2><p>First, let’s talk about what a therapy massage gun is. These tools, once used primarily by runners and other serious athletes, are designed to <a href=#>decrease muscle soreness</a> and improve your overall range of motion. They use vibration, also called “percussive therapy,” to simulate the moves a masseuse would make with her hands, targeting specific areas (such as your back) and providing quick bursts of pressure that penetrate deep into your muscle tissue. The best massage guns for back pain also increase blood flow to sore spots, helping to reduce inflammation and break up stubborn knots.</p><p>There are many types of massage guns for back pain, and the best one for you will depend on what exactly you’re looking for, as well as how much you want to spend. No matter your budget, there is one that will work for you!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is a massage gun worth it?</h2><p>If you’re unsure whether to fork over the cost of a premium massage gun for back pain, you can start with a more affordable model that’s designed for those on a budget. The best way to know whether a massage gun will be worth it for you is to read reviews — and check the return policy. Many companies offer money-back guarantees, so if you don’t love it, you have nothing to lose.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are cheap massage guns any good?</h2><p>As we said above, some of the best massage guns for back pain are perfect for people watching their pennies. That said, if you want a massage therapy gun that will last for a long time and give you the most bang for your buck, you may want to consider investing in a more expensive model. One way to think about it is to consider how much you would spend on a professional massage, and how many times a year you would get one if you could. Do the math, then compare that with the cost the best massage therapy gun for back pain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best massage gun on Amazon?</h2><p>If you’ve been investigating massage therapy gun options at all, you’ve probably seen the brand names Hypervolt, Theragun (now called Therabody), TimTam, and Vybe. However, there are plenty of massage guns available on Amazon with five-star reviews and happy customers, including the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Legiral Massage Gun (Buy on Amazon, $139.99)</a></strong>.</p><p>No matter which massage therapy gun you choose, relief from back pain will soon be on the way!

That pain is around 95 percent gone after the Theragun … [I tried] physical therapy, I tried the hot tub which got me by for years, I strengthened the muscles, tried acupuncture, massage therapy, then found yoga … the Theragun has changed everything. I would still have days where I would just lie on the floor in pain [because] standing and sitting aggravated my upper&nbsp;back. With the Theragun, I no longer have body tension and the very painful knots in the&nbsp;back&nbsp;are completely gone. Life-changing. So thankful for the creators of this product.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">3.
