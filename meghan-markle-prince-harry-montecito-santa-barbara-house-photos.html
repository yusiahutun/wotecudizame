Variety also reports that Meghan and Harry scored a discount for the house, which was bought by Russian businessman Sergey Grishin in 2009 for $25.3 million. Grishin had been selling the house for a decade before accepting the $10 million loss that Meghan and Harry purchased it for.</p><p>Now onto the details: Built in 2003, the Mediterranean-style main house includes beige and off-white decor. Inside, there’s a library, a gym, separate wet and dry saunas, an elevator, an arcade, a game room and a home theater. The estate also has a guest house, with two bedrooms and bathrooms.

Previous listings for the property also report that the estate has a “tea house,” a “children’s cottage” and rose gardens. Variety also reports that there are century-old olive trees, tall Italian cypress trees, a full-sized tennis court, a lap-lane swimming pool and a built-in children’s play set on the property.

The couple <a href=# rel=noopener>moved to Los Angeles</a> after a few <a href=# rel=noopener>months in Canada</a>, where Meghan used to live while filming her <a href=# rel=noopener>USA show Suits</a>. Meghan and Harry made the cross-world <a href=# rel=noopener>move to North America</a> in January after announcing their decision to take a step back as senior members of the British royal family.</p><p>“After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,” the couple wrote in a statement on their Instagram at the time.</p><p>They continued, “It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity. We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kG1taWlpZLqms8eapWalkae4rbGMqamippOaeqmt0auwZqWfo8Gmr8itpmarkaPBonnBmqmbmaKWeqm71KycZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
