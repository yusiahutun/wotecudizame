Here, we chat with the rising artist about when she realized she wanted to become a singer and DJ and what it was like working with Meghan Trainor.</p><p><b>Cliché: When did you first realize your passion for music?<br></b><b>Chloe Jane: </b>When I was about 10 years old, I started singing and playing the piano. Songwriting came a year later.</p><p><b>What inspired you to become a singer and DJ?<br></b>My parents met in Ibiza, which is one of the biggest music islands in the world, and every summer I went to Ibiza. That’s how my ear opened up to music and how I wanted to learn to DJ.</p><p><b>Do your singing career and DJ career go hand in hand or are they completely separate?<br></b>My singing career and DJ career do go hand-in-hand. When I sing and record songs, I then play them when I DJ. It gives me a good sense of how people react to my song.</p><p><b>How do you stand out compared to other young artists?<br></b>I sing, play piano, songwrite, DJ, dance, and ice-skate. I also do makeup tutorials, write fashion blogs, edit my own videos, design clothes, and design headphones.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>When I sing and record songs, I then play them when I DJ. It gives me a good sense of how people react to my song.</b></span></p><p><b>Tell us about your single “Superstar.” How was working with Meghan Trainor?<br></b>“Superstar” is an exciting song. It’s catchy and upbeat, which is great for my audience. Meghan co-wrote the song with my producers, the Elev3n, who then recorded the song with me. It was lots of fun and a great learning experience for me.</p><p><b>What projects are you currently working on?<br></b>This summer, I have a residency at one of the most amazing clubs in Ibiza called Amnesia. I will be performing shows for teenagers and playing great music, including my songs.</p><p><b>What are your plans for the future?<br></b>I want to keep writing and recording new music to be released throughout the rest of this year.</p><p></p><p>Read more <a href=# rel=noopener>Music Interviews</a> on ClicheMag.com</p><p><span>Chloe Jane Talks Her Budding Dj And Singing Career.
