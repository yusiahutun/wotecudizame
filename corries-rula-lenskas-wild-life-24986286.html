most iconic (and cringeworthy) moments along with George Galloway, back in 2006.</p><p>Viewers couldn't believe what they were seeing when the Scottish politician was pretending to be Rula's cat.</p><p>He was shown crawling on all fours, purring and pretending to lick cream from Rula's hands, while she stroked him.</p><p>The moment has been voted the 'cringiest' time in reality TV

quit the role to join the Calendar Girls tour, but she returned to the cobbles in July 2018 until April 2020 following the split with Ken Barlow.</p><p>Claudia has caused plenty of drama over the years, thanks to a rivalry with Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24697737.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS140178712jpeg.jpg><p>The pair previously fell out over hair stylist Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon), as well as their mutual love interest Marc Selby, leading to a frosty atmosphere between the former friends.</p><p>Fans will be thrilled to have her back in Weatherfield following the tragic death of the much-loved Norris, and it seems he's dropped a bombshell about who has been doing Rita's hair on the sly...</p><h3>Early Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Rula may be best known for her stage and screen appearances in the UK but over in the US she made a name (and recognisable face) for herself thanks to a series of adverts for Alberto VO5 hairspray in the late 70s and early 80s.</p><p>Her big break on screen was playing the role of Q, a Little Ladies band member in the 1976 TV show Rock Follies.</p><p>She later appeared in the sequel, Rock Follies of '77.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

somewhat, as on the Tonight Show Johnny Carson asked "Who the hell is Rula Lenska?"and her name became a running joke on the show.</p><p>As well as Coronation Street, Rula appeared in the likes of Footballers' Wives, One Foot In The Grave, Casualty, Space:1999, and Doctors.</p><p>She appeared in another soap, starring as Frank Butcher's girlfriend called Krystle, back in 2002.</p><h3>Bikini snaps</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24986305.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Rula-Lenska.jpg><p>Rula looked unrecognisable as she appeared in resurfaced bikini snaps from her modelling hey-day, looking incredible in a number of skimpy swimsuits.</p><p>One snap showed her in a plunging dark two-piece as she leaned back against her heel to show off her washboard stomach.</p><p>Rocking her famous red hair in a bouffant style, Rula looked incredible as she smouldered for the camera in the stylish pictures.</p><h3>Divorce</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24986307.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Rula-Lenska-who-stars-in-the-Rock-Follies-TV-Series.jpg><p>Rula has been married twice, and her first husband was actor Brian Deacon, from 1977 to 1987. The couple had one daughter, Laura.</p><p>Rula later married actor Dennis Waterman in 1987, after meeting on the set of Minder.</p><p>She was his third wife, and they remained married until 1998, divorcing after a difficult marriage.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Piers Morgan in 2012, Dennis confessed to hitting Rula on a few occasions, but added: “She certainly wasn’t a beaten wife, she was hit and that’s different.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24999081.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PAY-RULA-LENSKA-1972.jpg><p>There was a huge backlash following his admission, and Rula's agent, Paul Pearson, told the Mirror: "She’s pleased that Dennis has finally admitted what he did, but at the same time it’s all very upsetting."</p><p>"Rula has spent years living with this, while a huge number of people within the industry did not believe her, and she’s had to face that."</p><h3>Famous Stepdaughter</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24986310.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Waterman-accused-on-Lenska-comments.jpg><p>Dennis Waterman's daughter Hannah is a familiar face for many soap fans.</p><p>Hannah played the role of Laura Dunn in February 2000, later marrying Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).</p><p>Her character was eventually killed off in 2004, as she fell down the stairs in her flat after tripping over a toy.</p><p>Waterman's mother, Patricia, appeared in a few episodes in 2001 playing Laura's mum, and Rula appeared in EastEnders while Laura was in the show.</p><p>However, Rula appeared after she had split up with Dennis, and the pair never appeared on screen together.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>here.</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLCwvtGinKxloqq5onnLnqWso5Goeri1y51kpaGWmnpzgJhxbWtwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
