The couple separated in April, just weeks before Variety went public with claims from a woman identifying herself as Jane Doe. They are expecting another child together later in 2023.
“The divorce case is still pending, as my wife and I are working to resolve things together as a family,” he says."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a statement, he said he had waited several months to countersue because he “wanted to fix my family first.”</p><p>“What I meant by ‘fixing my family first,’ was making sure their mental health and stability are OK in light of these hurtful, false allegations,” Allen tells People. “I took some time off to be with my wife, kids and friends, to ensure everyone was OK.”</p><p>Allen previously turned to social media on May 18 to <a href=#>apologize publicly</a> to his wife and kids for what he termed an "affair." He later deleted that post.</p><p>In a <a href=#>statement to Taste of Country</a> on Thursday, the lawyer for both Jane Does,&nbsp;Elizabeth Fegan, expressed no surprise that Allen countersued her clients.</p><p>"We’ve reviewed the recent filings from Allen’s legal team and they’re what we’d expect — claims that all his encounters with Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 were consensual," Fegan writes. "We're eager to show the court abundant evidence to the contrary, which we believe will prove that Jimmie Allen is a serial abuser and should be held accountable for his actions."</p><p>"It is becoming increasingly common for perpetrators to countersue their victims, claiming defamation," she adds. "This is a concerning trend, one designed to convince victims that if they speak out, they will be the target of spurious litigation."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>60 Country Stars' Real Names Revealed</h2><p>Now organized alphabetically to help you find the real name you're searching for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6GdoramecClo56mXay2p7GMmqOesJmoeri70aSgp59dqbxuvsSspqWulWK6or7RopignV2osrnBwKVkmqujlsKtwIylmLCrpZ7BtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
