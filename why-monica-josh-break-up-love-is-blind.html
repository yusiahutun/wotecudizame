Monica Rodriguez hinted in an Instagram post in April 2023 that she and Josh Demas got engaged before he got back together with Jackelina “Jackie” Bonds on Love Is Blind Season 4. “LIB ENGAGEMENT ALERT*** Since EVERYONE was given the opportunity to share their stores, I can finally tell mine,” Monica captioned a photo of her engagement ring. “Many of you have messaged me about my journey asking if I found love in the pods. As many of you might know, not all stories are shown on camera. When I joined Love is Blind I was truly ready to find the love of my life. I had spent intentional time working on myself and ensuring I was who I wanted to be, for myself and my future partner. I wanted to show up emotionally/mentally healthy and available.”</p><p>She continued, “This experiment encouraged me to be vulnerable and share parts of myself that are not easily accessible. As my relationships began to develop, I thought I had found somebody who finally saw me and accepted me for me. I accepted his proposal and we were onto the reveal.”</p><p>In her post, Monica explained that she and Josh broke up after she had doubts he was The One following their reveal. “During the reveal, reality set in and my heart and mind were torn. I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision or picked the right person,” she wrote. “The only thing I did know was that you shouldn’t feel torn on your engagement day. It should be a decision in your life that is made with great confidence and no second thoughts.”</p><p>She continued, “This is when I realized that this wasn’t gods plan for me. I wasn’t at peace with my decision and ended our engagement shortly after filming. Since then, I have continued to work on myself and am grateful to Love is Blind for the opportunity to participate in an experiment where people really do find their person. I wouldn’t change anything about my experience. I’m proud of myself for giving love another chance. I continue to keep an open heart for the person god has single-handedly designed for me. Thank you for reaching out and for all the love and support you’ve sent my way. May everyone find their someone one day.”</p><p>Monica also confirmed that she kept Josh’s engagement ring. “And yes, I kept the ring 💍 @loveisblindnetflix #loveisblindfinale,” she wrote. Though Monica didn’t name Josh in her post, fans discovered that her fiance was Josh based on articles about other engaged men who weren’t shown in Love Is Blind Season 4. Along with Monica and Josh, two other engagements also weren’t shown in Love Is Blind Season 4, according to Netflix’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Tudum</a> site: Jimmy Fode and Wendi Kong; and Ava Van Jenson and JP Shultz.</p><p>Monica appeared at cast party on Love Is Blind Season 4’s “After the Altar” special, where she got into an argument with Josh and Jackie, who was her best friend while filming in The Pods, over her Instagram post. Josh and Jackie felt like Monica trying to cause drama with her post, while Monica claimed that she just wanted to tell her side of her story that wasn’t shown on TV. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> in September 2023, Chelsea Griffin, another Love Is Blind Season 4 cast member, slammed Monica for still being hung up on Josh. “You can’t go into something like that and not expect some drama,” she said. “Everybody has feelings and everyone’s a human being, and they all had their experience on Love Is Blind. And that’s what I wanted to reiterate there.”</p><p>Chelsea continued, “My stance was like, ‘Well, hold on. We don’t need to go there. Yes, it happened, but let’s just acknowledge all of your experiences. And Josh, if you’re with Jackie and you’re happy, let’s be that.’ I just wanted everyone to acknowledge and accept because I feel like that’s a beautiful way and the only way to move on.”</p><p>Chelsea also explained she wanted to stay out of Monica, Josh, and Jackie’s drama. “I was just there and it was coming to me and I was like, ‘OK, well if it’s coming to me, I’m going to say how would I feel about it.’ Nobody can come up to me and ever think they’re not going to get a rational point of view,” she said. “Everybody, go home, be happy. Live their lives.”</p><p>Kwame Appiah, who married Chelsea on Love Is Blind Season 4, also gave his take on Monica, Josh, and Jackie’s love triangle. “I saw it out of the corner of my eye. For most of that night, I was talking to Brett [Brown] and Marshall [Glaze]. We were kind of in our own world,” he told People. “I was really just all on the good vibes bandwagon that night. I was not trying to be part of any drama.”</p><p>He continued, “I don’t really talk or associate with Josh and Jackie in my regular days, so it’s not something that I had to force in that situation. I wasn’t just going to be like, ‘Oh, we’re all here. Let’s force a conversation.’ So when I saw them having their own moment, I just said, ‘It wouldn’t be right for me to force myself into something that I don’t, in our regular day lives, have any impact on.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLW6ecyopaKbkWK3sL%2FHZpmrnZGgera8jKWmr51dnsBursuipZ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
