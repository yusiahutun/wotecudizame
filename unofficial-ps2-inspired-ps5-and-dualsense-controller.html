You can also grab retro PS2-style DualSense controllers, too.</p><p>So, if nostalgia is a big thing for you, then $649 will net you a custom PS5, while an additional $99 will land you the unofficially modified DualSense controller.</p><p>Given that Sony doesn't seem to take kindly to third-party companies selling modded consoles (it has <a href=#>previously shut down an unofficial PS5 faceplate brand</a>) so be careful if you plan to buy the black PS5 as it isn't an official Sony product.</p><h2 id=what-does-the-ps2-themed-ps5-look-like>What Does the PS2-Themed PS5 Look Like?</h2><p>Well, it looks like a PS2, of course! All of the white faceplates have been replaced with matte black plates.</p><p>In a similar vein, the PS5 DualSense controller has undergone an overhaul, with the white components biting the dust in favor of black panels that emulate the appearance of the PS2 DualShock Controller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How the PlayStation Controller Has Evolved from PS1 to PS5</a></span></p><p>Across both the console and the DualSense controllers, we see the return of the familiar red, yellow, green, and blue PlayStation logo (although we don't know whether this is rotatable on the console, as with the original PS2).</p><h2 id=how-does-sup3r5-create-the-ps2-themed-ps5-console>How Does SUP3R5 Create the PS2-Themed PS5 Console?</h2><p>According to its website, SUP3R5 manufactures its consoles with the greatest of care.</p><p>It completely disassembles the DualSense controller, removing the guts of the device and packing them into a new chassis, made using PS2-black plastic. Technicians wear gloves throughout this process to avoid damaging the components.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ps5-dualsense-with-PS2-dualshock-theme.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You should be aware, though, that this voids the DualSense warranty and, as a result, Sony's guarantee won't protect you if your controller doesn't work properly (or at all).</p><p>The warranty for the PS5 will remain intact, as SUP3R5 only has to remove the faceplates from the console, and not open the console itself.</p><h2 id=can-you-buy-the-ps2-themed-ps5>Can You Buy the PS2-Themed PS5?</h2><p>You can, it is simply a matter of heading to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the SUP3R5 website</a> and placing a pre-order, although the option to order is currently unavailable. Pre-orders are due to go live on January 8, 2020, as the company sets its merchant system up to combat bots and scalpers.</p><p>There will be 500 PS2-themed DualSense controllers to snap up, and 304 limited edition custom PS5 consoles to buy.</p><p>Why 304? SUP3R5 explains in a tweet:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned, there has been a lot of trouble with scalpers securing PS5 stock and selling it at exorbitant prices. The official white PS5 standard edition, with optical drive, normally costs $499.</p><p>This custom PS5 costs an extra $150 so, if you are willing to pay a bit extra, this might be the best chance you have of securing the coveted Sony console.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-ps2-themed-ps5>Should You Buy the PS2-Themed PS5?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sony-playstation-2.png><p>If you like nostalgia and you have a spare $800, then you could try and pre-order the PS2-inspired PlayStation 5. However, this is a new brand and Sony will undoubtedly have its eye on proceedings, so exercise extreme caution.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you want to feel that PS2 sentimentality, then there are plenty of PS2 games to play over on PS Now, the PlayStation game streaming service. Perhaps just net yourself a regular console (when stock is available) and get your retro kicks that way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGisp6eWm7aktcClZKmrYmK2r7%2FPoqmenF2lwHZ5wKebZpyllrm0sc2snGabn6PBs7vLpZyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
