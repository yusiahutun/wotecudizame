Paul is known for the coveted “Hollywood handshake” he dishes out when a contestant really impresses him, while Prue is known for her fabulous, neon nanna outfits. Providing the comic relief (and you’d be surprised how much these bakers need it given the stressful environment of The Tent!) and words of encouragement to the contestants are Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas, much like they have since 2020. Though neither Noel or Matt know much about baking, their careers as cheeky, boundary-pushing comedians make them the perfect fit for this role. “Both Matt and Noel get away with murder. They’re both very funny and charming, so they get away with more than other people would,” Paul Hollywood said of the hosts in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>September 2022 interview</a>.</p><h2>Who are The Great British Baking Show 2022 contestants?</h2><p>A fresh lineup of ambitious bakers has hit the tent. The Great British Baking Show 2022 contestants include:</p><ul><li>Abdul, 29, electronics engineer</li><li>Carole, 59, a supermarket cashier</li><li>Dawn, 60, IT manager</li><li>James, 25, nuclear scientist</li><li>Janusz, 24, teacher’s assistant</li><li>Kevin, 33, music teacher</li><li>Maisam, 18, student and sales assistant</li><li>Maxy, 29, architectural assistant</li><li>Rebs, 23, Master’s student</li><li>Sandro, 30, nanny</li><li>Syabira, 32, cardiovascular research associate</li><li>Will, 45, former charity director</li></ul><h2>What are the Great British Baking Show rules?</h2><p>Twelve talented amateur bakers will be competing for the title of Master Baker White Tent this year. Each week, they’ll participate in three tasks designed around a different weekly theme that tests their baking skills and knowledge (French week, gluten-free week, bread week, etc.). Anyone who’s baked can attest it is a very precise art! The first round in an episode is what’s known as the Signature Challenge, the one where bakers show off their tried and tested recipes. The Technical Challenge tests their technical knowledge and requires them to follow a recipe with very limited instructions, the struggle being to guess the quantities and measurements of ingredients. The final round is the Showstopper Challenge in which the skills and finesse come together to make a centerpiece that really blows the judges away. Each week, the contestant that performs the best is given the Star Baker title, while the person that performs the poorest out of the group is sent home.</p><h2>Where is the Great British Baking Show filmed?</h2><p>Since 2020, the series has been filmed in the English countryside on the grounds of a private estate called Welford Park. The famous White Tent is pitched on a beautiful green lawn close to the main house, the grounds of which are welcome to guests from February to March.</p><h2>Which celebrities have been in the Great British Baking Show?</h2><p>There have been many high-profile guests over the years in the various special episodes, usually to benefit a charity. Stars like Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy, James Blunt, Tan France, Richard Dreyfuss, Louis Theroux, John Lithgow, Russell Brand and Teri Hatcher are among some of the biggest names to appear in The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer, a nonprofit that donates funds to cancer research and ground-breaking treatments.</p><p><i>The Great British Baking Show </i>is available to stream on Channel 4 with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">VPN</a>.
