I watch these shows. I was curious to get to know them on a different level. I’d met all of them at different NBC events, but I didn’t know them,” she said. “I was very intrigued. I was like, ‘Well, there can’t really be any arguments. How could there be? It’s not like we’re in the same franchise. There’s no history.’ Right out of the gate, something happens. We hadn’t even landed yet, and there was already a problem. I was like, ‘Wow. Even for me, this is a lot.’”</p><p>So how can one watch the Real Housewives online for free?

Read on ahead for various tips and tricks to stream the<i> Real Housewives</i> at no cost, whether it’s live or the next day. Pro tip: Combine the free trials and set a reminder to cancel your subscription before you’re charged to watch the Real Housewives online for free all season long.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sling TV’s free trial </a>is an excellent option to watch the Real Housewives for cheap. Sling offers two plans: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sling Blue</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sling Orange.</a> (Sling Blue is more suited for news and entertainment, while Sling Orange is better for sports and family.) Both include a three-day free trial and cost $35 per month after the trial ends, if one chooses to subscribe. Both also offer 50 hours of DVR and local channels. Only Sling Blue offers Bravo for the Real Housewives. Both plans are also available under Sling Orange & Blue, which costs $50 per month. If you had to choose one, though, we recommend <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sling Blue</a> to watch the Real Housewives. Not only does the plan include more channels, but it also allows the user to stream on three devices (Sling Orange allows only one), which means that you can split the cost with two other people, who can stream on their own devices. (That’s just $3.33 per person.)</p><p>The best way to watch the NFL draft online for free is with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Fubo TV’s free trial</a>.

After the free trial ends, Fubo TV costs $64.99 per month, so be sure to cancel it before you’re charged.</p><p>The best way to watch the Real Housewives online for free is with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">VPN</a>, which allows users to set their computer’s location to another country and access websites that would otherwise be restricted by their location.

One of the best VPN services out there is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ExpressVPN</a>, which is easy to use and offers a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">30-day free trial</a>.</p><p>The service is also a lot more affordable than other VPN services out there.

As for Hayu, the service costs $6.99 per month after its 30-day free trial ends, which means that it costs just $15.31 to subscribe to both Hayu and ExpressVPN to watch the Real Housewives hours after new episodes air. That’s about $40 less than most cable services. Along with the Real Housewives, Hayu also offers more than 250 other shows, including <a href=# rel=noopener>international Real Housewives shows</a>, the Below Deck&nbsp;franchise and The Bachelor franchise—all of which upload new episodes the day after they air.</p><p>Here are step-by-step instructions to sign up for Hayu and ExpressVPN.</p><li>Sign up for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ExpressVPN</a></li><li>Log into your account and click “Download” on the “Dashboard” or in “Set Up Your Devices”</li><li>Once you’ve installed ExpressVPN, enter the “Activation Code” from the “Dashboard” or in “Set Up Your Devices”</li><li>Once ExpressVPN is set up, change your location to the UK, Canada or Australia</li><li>Sign up for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hayu</a></li><li>Log into your account and start watching Hayu</li><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu+ With Live TV</a> is another option to watch the the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Real Housewives&nbsp;online for free.</a> Along with access to Hulu’s library of 80,000 movies and TV shows, the service also offers more than 75 live channels, including Bravo to watch the <i>Real housewies</i>, as well as 50 hours of DVR.
