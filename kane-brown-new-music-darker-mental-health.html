Now, as he works on new material, Brown says that his fans can expect to hear more songs focused around those tough topics.</p><p>"Recently, I've been writing a lot of music. I actually wrote three the other day," Brown detailed to <a href=#>ET Canada</a> in a February interview.</p><p>"I will say I have a couple of songs that are a little bit darker, about mental health," the singer continues. "And then I have a song called 'Learning,' that I went a little bit more in depth over the stuff that I went through, so I'm really excited about the music that we're writing right now."</p><p>Brown -- whose most recent album is Different Man, a project that arrived in September 2022 -- explains that he's gotten more comfortable sharing subject matter that's close to the chest over the course of his time in the music industry.</p><p>"I've always been pretty open about that stuff, and the longer I'm in the business, I just get more and more comfortable [talking about it]. But a lot of people are talking about it now, and I think it's making it a little bit...easier for other people to talk about it as well," he continues.</p><p>Currently, Brown is celebrating his most recent No. 1 hit: "Thank God," a duet with his wife <a href=#>Katelyn Brown</a>. In the weeks ahead, he is also set to co-host the CMT Music Awards with <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini</a>, and he'll also make his acting debut with a role in the <a href=#>CBS series Fire Country.</a></p><p><strong>See Inside Kane Brown's Luxurious Rural Retreat:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmemnqjvs6wpWamlax6rsHSoppmnJGnuKa%2BjKacp6yRoXqpscClq6Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
