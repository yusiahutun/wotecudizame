He said, "Point those biscuits' (feet) and I think that is a great note.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72030f53c2ab-170401cw101025.jpg><p id=e8T9JXN7kk data-wc=41>For me, the note would be, again, to put emotion through the body more than the facial expressions. When she extends her arms, instead of just throwing an arm out there without emotion, it's got to come from the rib cage.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOzdN4sPs8M data-wc=47>But in order for Alyson and Sasha to break into the nines and tens, I'm hoping that next week they are challenged to do an actual ballroom or Latin dance. When she did the quickstep, she nailed all the steps and that's how she got that nine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Xochitl's 40&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4cb5037bbf4d-170401cw101377.jpg><p id=eHugZ9Dz0S data-wc=46>It was a solid tango for Xochitl Gomez and her partner, but I would have given her a nine because, for me, tango is about the intensity and the attack, and it was a little too happy when it came to the expression on their faces.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5kaqgihZm data-wc=25>But the quality of movement, the body contact, the frame – you couldn't compare it to any other couple tonight so they deserve the 40.&nbsp;</p><h2>Guest judge Billy Porter&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d2881f9072bf-170401cw100391.jpg><p id=e9h_wfWqTs data-wc=73>Billy Porter was an amazing judge this week. I thought he was one of the better guest judges as he did not go easy on them and what he said was right, even though maybe some of the words weren't necessarily spot on. But when it comes to his advice and what he wanted to see when it comes to intention, I think that is what a guest judge should be looking for.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYFGVeMBUc data-wc=24>I thought Paula Abdul was a great judge, but I prefer someone like Billy because he's so opinionated and he knows what he wants.&nbsp;</p><h2>The final straight&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/419cb8cf5aae-170401cw101545.jpg><p id=eo7JGn5LeS data-wc=74>As a professional it is now truly coming down to details and I think at the end of the day, you need to remind your celebrity partner that they are always the last dance. At this point, there's certain things now that are in these celebrities – muscle memories that they can't throw out the window – but what you need to do is really take to heart what these judges are looking for.&nbsp;</p><p id=ex4ZC8aulo data-wc=25>I think that's going to be hard for Alyson and Sasha because all of the comments were compliments so what are they going to do?&nbsp;</p><h2>Jason Mraz's last shot&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6b1f4e60981f-170401cw100786.jpg><p id=eEDewXAcYm data-wc=63>Jason started so strong but maybe the judges didn't score him right. Last week, I thought what he did last week with his jazz number was brilliant but this fall in scores is getting to his psyche a little bit. If he can just throw that out the window, get a new mindset, and have zero expectations, I think he can start over.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehlSC36dra data-wc=9>But I think this is his last shot though.</p><p id=eeJETiSvw6 data-wc=31></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
