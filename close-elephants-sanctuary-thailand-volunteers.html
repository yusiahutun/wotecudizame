My fellow travellers chorus a gasp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/8e6255fc-db2e-4f73-a2ea-6df975aeb580_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a cup of hill-tribe-farmed coffee, guide Sophon “Home” Nanthawan shows me around. To my surprise, no barriers separate man and beast; only the banyan trees are shielded from harm, by stone circles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The trees are sacred to Buddhists,” explains Home, before introducing the elephants as if they were old friends. “This one is called Deepor and that’s her buddy Yaiboon. That one over there covering herself in mud is called Pikul,” he says, explaining that elephants plaster themselves in it to keep cool but also to stop insects from biting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/6256d0a6-55c5-4196-8998-51d76c782c9f_818b368a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/dea14a74-c84e-4e30-8ed8-d53c549c0fed_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each elephant is kept by a mahout (an elephant caretaker) and we are advised to maintain our distance if an animal seems ruffled. But by and large, the elephants are unperturbed by us humans and we’re able to enjoy an intimate audience with Earth’s second largest land animal, after their African cousins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After walking with the elephants, we explore more of the 100-hectare (247-acre) park, to get acquainted with the other inhabitants: water buffalo, horses, rabbits, cats and dogs that have all been rescued from some form of torment or other, including slaughterhouses, abusive parks, laboratories, wet markets or simply the streets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sky trail – an elevated pathway overlooking a tea-coloured river – provides a more comprehensive picture of the sylvan Mae Taeng Valley. An intensely organic aroma assails the nostrils. Insects chirp with the consistency of a metronome, and birdsong is interrupted by the occasional trumpet of a distant bull elephant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/666ad2fe-7693-4631-8ddb-e9337136c7d5_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With few evening distractions, I retire early for the first of my two nights at the park. Volunteers stay for up to two weeks and share a room with one or two others. Before the pandemic, the park could rely on 60 volunteers per week. The number now that coronavirus restrictions have been eased is averaging between 10 and 20 per week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I rise early – to shovel dung. It’s tough going in the rain, but the mood is buoyed by the rapport between the park volunteers – there are eight in my group – and the animals they are tasked with taking care of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following elephant toilet duties, we shower and head to the kitchen to clean and sort mangoes. The morning shift concludes with the wrapping of sticky rice and bananas for the older elephants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/23b1885b-cff3-4f31-83ee-05c29980a8cd_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have a tonne [1,000kg] of fruit delivered daily,” Home says, while we tuck into a vegan lunch. This is not surprising when one considers an adult elephant weighs between two and four tonnes, and needs to eat 10 per cent of its body weight per day, much of which the animals at the park forage for themselves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nevertheless, food preparation is a major part of the day-to-day operations, especially as hungry volunteers like me aspire to eat 10 per cent of their body weight, too, when presented with sumptuous tofu and vegetable dishes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The park’s main building, also referred to as Platform One, is an open, two-storey, stilted structure made largely of wood with solar panels on its gently arched roof. It houses a small exhibition of the park’s endeavours, a communal eatery and the kitchen in which volunteers and employees prepare food for the animals. It also has a coffee shop, with a terrace, on which I take a midafternoon break as the tropical sun finally breaks through the clouds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/025e501e-0b4f-43ea-9594-e593e332330c_1126e908.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/4f85c0d3-56e8-4844-a01a-0548c2914951_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lumbering female elephant passes a small herd of water buffalo en route to the river, and a petite woman scoots up to me on an e-trike.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love that one, she always puts leaves on her head,” she says, pointing to the elephant’s frond-coated crown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/2727c93d-1a92-4786-b209-1cb114a0ddb6_6ab366ca.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lek is an ethnic Khmu; her ancestors came to Thailand from the mountains of neighbouring Laos. As a child, she says, she was subject to discrimination as a female member of a hill tribe: “As a woman, you’re expected to make babies and work on the farm. I was the only girl to go to school, and the other kids would stamp on my feet because I had no shoes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would tell the pigs my problems and they would lick my tears away. Even though they could not speak, I could really feel their emotion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When her porcine friends were taken away to be slaughtered, Lek became a vegetarian, an expression of a compassion for animals that would come to define her life (she has since become vegan).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/c5319ca9-2491-4bfe-94c0-79da66d197b6_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After studying art at Chiang Mai Rajabhat University, she worked in the tourism industry, which was growing fast in the 1980s. But the mistreatment of elephants, including the widespread use of chains and bull hooks, convinced her to devote her time to championing animal rights across Southeast Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Based on “compassion, understanding and respect” for animals, her nature park offers visitors an intimate and meaningful experience rather than the cheap thrill of riding an elephant or watching animals perform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many of the parks claiming to be sanctuaries still use hooks and chains,” says Lek. “It’s just branding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/60b8eba1-4b98-4012-b879-0f7115308f14_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it’s the spread of Covid-19 over the past two-and-a-half years that occupies her thoughts most these days, as the disease brought with it a host of unforeseen problems for elephants throughout Thailand.</p>“Many of the parks in places like Phuket or Pattaya don’t own their elephants, they lease them. When it became clear the pandemic was going to last more than a few months, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the park owners, who had no tourist revenue</span></a>, told the owners to come and get their elephants.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stories of owners walking their animals across Thailand, stopping in urban centres such as Chiang Mai to beg for food and water, abound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/bdb3b96d-e4c2-4296-9495-fedf0bf24aec_6ab366ca.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At first, [SEF] simply gave money to the mahouts and food for the elephants. But after three months, when our funds ran low, we decided to start an elephant food bank programme with the help of some American non-profits we work with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We worked with local farmers [across northern Thailand], asking them to plant pumpkins and bananas with the condition they didn’t spray pesticides. We bought from them and invited elephant camps in need to request food.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A foster care project was developed – individuals may sponsor an elephant for six months for US$56 – to support those animals “in desperate need” and to date, Lek and her team have been able to support 260 camps and an estimated 2,000 elephants through the coronavirus crisis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/4eb7bfd9-8b8f-4dac-a51a-dfea8e6816d2_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lot of imagination has gone into devising new revenue streams. “We’ve also made some money from our cakes,” Lek says of an initiative whereby supporters can purchase a personalised jumbo cake made of locally sourced ingredients and watch a video online as it is fed to the elephants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet economic strains have grown manifest in animal welfare issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“During the height of the pandemic, an owner brought three elephants here and asked us to help, he had nowhere else to take them,” she says. “The other day, someone dropped 15 puppies at my gate. We’re totally full now. I dream of buying more land, to watch my animals roam more freely, but that will take a lot more money.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/8cf5e8cf-a539-4be5-9c81-c862f065651c_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Standing by the river, Lek broadcasts an impressively loud holler for someone less than five feet (152cm) in height. Elephants arrive one by one until there are five feeding on the lychees she is dishing out. The fruit is in season and grows all around the valley.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s clear Lek has developed a special bond with her charges, kissing their trunks, singing lullabies and even communicating in some non-verbal way. It’s easy to forget that this tiny, mud-spattered woman holds a position on the Thai parliament’s committee for wild elephant protection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Walking back to Platform One, Lek appears revived, an almost maternal glow emanating from her cheeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/09/d255a09c-d72f-40ca-86a5-a16e2ff992f6_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You know, some scientists once got in touch with us and said they wanted to try and bring mammoths back to life,” she says. “Can you believe that? I said what about trying to protect the animals we already have?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She pauses for a moment, then adds, “Sometimes I really don’t understand humans.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOramarpWhfKK%2B06KapZ1faH55fY9pbmibnKTApnnEpZypoJGjwbR50pqlnKyllr%2B6edOhmKKkkaOxbsLOpaynrJWav7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
