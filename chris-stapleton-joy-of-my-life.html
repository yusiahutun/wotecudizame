"Joy of My Life" is Stapleton's tender reinterpretation of Creedence Clearwater Revival country rocker John Fogerty's song from 1997.</p><p>While it may not be a Stapleton original, "Joy of My Life" fits perfectly into Stapleton's catalog: A tender, riffy love ballad, the song provides him ample opportunity to showcase his emotive singing style and subtly powerful guitar work.</p><p>Both as a cover and as a love song, "Joy of My Life" is a bit of a left turn from the previous singles Stapleton has released off Starting Over. The lead single was the title track, and showcased familiar material for Stapleton: The imaginative power of leaving the life he knows behind in favor of the open road, preferably with his partner riding shotgun. Two more singles -- the chart-topping "Cold" and "You Should Probably Leave," both of which won Grammy Awards in 2022 -- turned to darker, bluesier themes, describing troubled love affairs destined to leave one or both parties heartbroken.</p><p>"Joy of My Life" is Stapleton's happiest, most tender single yet off the project. A meditation on how lucky he feels to spend each day with his partner, the song feels like a continuation of "Millionaire," which was a hit for Stapleton in 2018.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?:</strong> "Joy of My Life" is one of three cover songs on Starting Over. The other two, "Worry B Gone" and "Old Friends," both come courtesy of Guy Clark.</p><p><strong>Chris Stapleton, "Joy of My Life" Lyrics:</strong></p><p>I tiptoed in the room / I know you got to have your rest / She says, "Come lay beside me, / I've been waiting since you left"</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>She's sweet to me / Must be the luckiest man alive / Did I tell you baby / You are the joy of my life?</p><p>The first time that I saw you / Mmm, you took my breath away / Might not get to Heaven / But I walked with the angels that day</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>She takes me by the hand / I am the luckiest man alive / Did I tell you baby / You are the joy of my life?</p><p>Some may have their riches / Some may have their worldly things / As long as I have you / I'll treasure each and every day</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>Just take me by the hand / I am the luckiest man alive / Did I tell you baby / You are the joy of my life?</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Check Out the Top 40 Country Songs of June 2022</a><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Hottest Country Songs of Summer 2022</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCinsBuv9Oap6WdpKS7brbOsmSonl2ixm64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
