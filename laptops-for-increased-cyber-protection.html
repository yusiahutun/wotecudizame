Many will find a brand they enjoy and stay with it, reluctant to branch out and adopt new ones even if other companies release better products. Apple, for instance, is a brand that has considerable customer loyalty despite seeing rising competition from companies that release equally innovative products and technologies.</p><p>However, as issues such as cybercrime increase in technology, now may be the time to buy products that will protect you rather than simply purchasing products from brands you love. This is especially important <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for business professionals</a> and students who use technologies like laptops daily to store personal, financial, and academic information. &nbsp;</p><p>As the prevalence of cybercrime continues to rise, individuals, like those in Sydney, should exercise greater caution in their online activities, recognizing the crucial role that well-maintained laptops play in protecting personal information. <a href=# rel=noopener>Businesses offering laptop repairs in Sydney</a> are addressing not only hardware issues but also placing a strong emphasis on cybersecurity, acknowledging the interconnected nature of device functionality and the evolving threat landscape.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Laptops for Increased Cyber Protection</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.&nbsp;MacBook Pro with Touch Bar</h3><p>If you travel frequently for work or school, there is always the risk of your laptop being stolen. Fortunately, Apple released the MacBook Pro with a TouchID fingerprint reader. The reader operates off a T1 chip, which helps isolate identity verification. So, even if someone steals your laptop, they won’t be able to get in and access your information. However, investing in tools like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VPN for Mac</a> is always a good idea. It will protect you from cybercrime and encrypt your data from third-party viewers who can watch and collect your online data when using a public Wi-Fi hotspot, such as in a coffee shop, library, or the airport. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Huawei Matebook X Pro</h3><p>It has become well-known over the years that laptop cameras and webcams pose a significant danger to your online privacy. Cybercriminals can get access to your camera, which is why The Guardian states many people have started to cover their laptop cameras with stickers or slides. Recognizing this trend, Huawei released the Matebook X Pro, which has the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">camera in a spring-loaded pop-up button</a> on the keyboard. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. ASUS ZenBook Flip 13</h3><p>Technology product experts have begun recommending the ASUS ZenBook Flip 13 for consumers looking for a portable and safe laptop. Not only does the laptop use OLED technology, creating a high-resolution display, and includes an 11th-generation Intel Quad Core processor, but it also boasts a sleek and lightweight design, making it ideal for on-the-go professionals and students alike.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Dell XPS 13</h3><p>Like the MacBook Pro and Huawei Matebook X Pro, the Dell XPS 13 has a hidden fingerprint reader on the keyboard and a low-angle webcam feature. Another benefit is that Dell is also compatible with various security solutions. &nbsp;</p><p>Brand loyalty is integral to today’s consumer world and determines whether a company succeeds or fails. However, this loyalty has become so extreme lately that people will favor products that may not be the best items on the market simply because they want the brand logo and to feel part of a community. When it comes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to technology products</a>, there are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many new trends</a>, but cybercrime is also an increasing concern. Therefore, it may be worth looking at products offering extra security features, even if it’s from a brand you wouldn’t usually purchase from. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLmivNOop6xllqS%2FbrXNnKmemaOasW6v2Jucq2Wgp7y1scKtoKim</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
