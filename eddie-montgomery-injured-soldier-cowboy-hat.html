Patrick Miller organized the concert, and Montgomery was one of the musical headliners.</p><p>Miller, who is an Iraq war veteran, was injured in April of 2014 when a fellow soldier, Spc. Ivan Antonio Lopez, <a href=#>opened fire</a> at Fort Hood Army Base in Texas, where Miller was then stationed. Miller was shot in the chest while running toward the gunfire to save his fellow soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet <a href=#>barely missed his heart</a>, striking two inches below it. Despite being injured and applying pressure to the wound, Miller continued to move soldiers out of harm's way and behind a door to safety.</p><p>Miller has found a way to help other injured veterans after surviving his injury by organizing the Southern Tier Wounded Warrior Benefit Concert. The third annual installment of the event featured performances from Montgomery,&nbsp; Meg and Tyler, Eric Van Houten and New York State Country Music Hall of Fame inductee Farmer Jack Ellis.</p><p>"You can hang it in your garden," Montgomery quips in the video of the moment. "It'll scare off the birds. It's great for target practice."</p><p>As the video concludes, Montgomery thanks Miller before calling him a "true American hero."</p><p>In a post shared along with the video, Montgomery continues his praise of Miller by saying, "You are an example of courage and service far above self sir - definitely Something To Be Proud Of."</p><p>He then concludes the post by thanking all of those who serve, saying, "God Bless you and all of our American Heroes."</p><p><strong>Riley Green's RISERS Performance Is So Powerful</strong></p><p><strong>See Country Artists Wearing the American Flag</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnpyUnrJuuc6nq6CnnZq%2FunnIp6GuqpWZerS7y52gnqpdmLy4rs6yZKGZpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
