A few years later, he became NBA Champion with the Cleveland Cavaliers after the Cleveland Cavaliers made an impressive run in the 2016 NBA season. Undoubtedly, Iman has had good times in his career, but still, he has been involved in misconduct that is not so praiseworthy for a player like him who strives for the top. But is he really guilty in the sense of the prosecution?</p><p>You can find out all about it here, but first, let’s take a look at the player’s background and see how persistent he has been on the basketball court over the years.</p><h2><strong>Early Life And Career Begining Of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Iman Shumpert</strong></h2><p>The baller was named Iman Asante Shumpert, after he was born on June 26, 1990, in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Odis Shumpert (father) and L’Tanya Shumpert (mother). Like his siblings: Kasani, Odis Jr., and Ahrii Schumpert (all boys), with whom he grew up in Oak Park, Illinois.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Iman-Shumpert.jpg><p>When he came of age, he enrolled at Oak Park and River Forest High School, where he began playing basketball more competitively. Iman was so impressive in his days as a high school basketball player, which is why he was an All-State player on the first team, was an MVP at conferences as a junior and senior, and played Parade All-American on the third team. After high school, the young ballplayer went to the Georgia Institute of Technology to play with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men’s basketball team.</p><p>In keeping with his nature, the impressive form he took in high school continued in college for the two seasons (2008-2011) he played B-ball as a college student. Asante was inducted into the ACC All-Freshman Team in 2009, the ACC All-Defensive Team, and a second All-ACC Team in 2011. On March 28, 2011, he signed up for the 2011 NBA Draft and decided to give up his remaining years of college qualification.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Miles Bridges Bio, NBA Career Stats, Height, Weight, Draft and Scouting Report</a></strong></p><p>The New York Knicks chose Iman Shumpert as their award-winning Shooting Guard for the 17th overall selection for the 2011 NBA Draft. Iman had a productive stay with the Knicks and earned a 2012 NBA All-Rookie First Team Award. Nonetheless, he also suffered several injuries during his stay with the Madison Square Garden-based team.</p><p>Shumpert’s next move was to join the Cleveland Cavaliers after the Knicks made a deal through him. With the Cavaliers, Iman watched the 2015 NBA final, which they, unfortunately, lost to the Golden State Warriors. When the next season arrived, he also helped his team to another NBA final, which they finally won against the Golden State Warriors after they refused to throw in the towel, even though they had lost 3-1 at the beginning. When his service with the Cleveland’s ended, Shumpert was again transferred to the Sacramento Kings on February 8, 2018, this time to the Sacramento Kings. He is looking forward to improving his career during his stay with the Kings.</p><h2><strong>Family: Wife, Daughter</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_34716 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-34716></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Iman-Shumpert-girlfriend-and-daughter.jpg><p>The Shooting Guard is married to Teyana Taylor; the famous American dancer, sound artist, actress, and model.

It happened that his former teammate of the Cavaliers, Tristan Thompson, had something to do with one of his side chicks claiming that there was more than one Cavs player she was drilling behind closed doors when she wrote to her Instagram account. Then she wrote a post about the missing Iman Shumpert, who quickly triggered rumors that Iman was cheating on his wife. As the rumors began to spread around April 2018, more and more people began to refute the allegations that Iman was cheating on Teyana. It did not take too long and the rumors died out. The couple is still together and their marriage continues strongly.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Nelson Agholor Girlfriend, Weight, Height, Body Stats, Biography</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The NBA Shooting Guard has an estimated net worth of $14 million.
