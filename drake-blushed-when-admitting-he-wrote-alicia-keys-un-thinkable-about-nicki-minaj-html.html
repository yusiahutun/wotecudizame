The topic of Drake’s verse in “Miss Me” came up, where he talked about wanting to marry Minaj.</p><p id=par-5_26>When Complex asked about her reaction to those lines, Minaj dished on that and the revelation that Drake wrote Alicia Keys’ “Un-thinkable” with her in mind.</p><p id=par-6_39>“He let me hear it for the first time when we did Jay’s show at Madison Square Garden, the day before Wayne had to go to jail—that night he let me hear it on the headphones,” she said.</p><p id=par-7_41>“But you know what else he told me he wrote for me? The Alicia Keys song ‘I’m Ready.’ I happen to love the song. I never told anyone that, I hope he won’t get mad that I said that,” Minaj added.</p><p id=par-8_29>She joked that Drake is a playboy and he probably ran the line on a lot of women. Minaj also downplayed any notions they were more than friends.</p><p id=par-9_35>“That’s the thing about Young Money, we will say a lot of crazy sh*t in the press but we will get around each other and start cracking up laughing like brothers and sisters,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-drake-admitted-un-thinkable-is-about-nicki-minaj>Drake admitted ‘Un-thinkable’ is about Nicki Minaj</h2><p id=par-10_35>“Un-thinkable (I’m Ready)” is a single on Alicia Keys’ 2009 album, The Element of Freedom. The song went double platinum and snagged the number 1 spot on Billboard’s R&B charts when it first dropped.</p><p id=par-11_21>But more than that, the lyrics are about acting on mutual romantic feelings. Some have described the song as part confession.</p><p id=par-12_33>Word got back to Drake that Minaj spilled what he told her about the Alicia Keys song, and in a sit-down with music journalist Carl Chery in 2013, he addressed whether it’s true.</p><p id=par-13_29>Grinning and blushing, Drake fumbled a bit before saying, “Yeah, it is. I’m not gonna lie.” He explained the song was inspired by a conversation he and Minaj had.</p><p id=par-14_37>“The concept came from a conversation that we’d had — or conversations we have. I wrote it based off two things. One, based off that and two, based off Alicia and Swizz and their situation,” said Drake.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_27>When Alicia Keys spoke to <a href=#>Complex</a> about the track in 2012, she said it was about letting go and taking chances — especially on what you love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxs63KnmSbpKWotaawjLCfnqZdlrGutdOtoKefXZ2ybsPRqKueZZGhtqS1wGainrGjYsKvedOhoKejkZe5pnnAm6aurF2jtqS3yGakoqaRn3upwMylZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
