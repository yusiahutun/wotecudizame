However, it doesn’t sound like it was his proudest moment on screen. He told Australian radio show Fitzy and Wippa that he <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">never wanted his kids</span></a> to see his work on the popular show.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/33d0bd28-0a8e-4fd3-b53e-ce29306da4d9_d57d8688.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t say the B-word at home. We hide all of that, mate!” Momoa joked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t talk about those words. The B-word didn’t happen. The earlier things in my career, you can’t see that,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/c05cbf6d-e3ad-4116-8bcb-4e78dc398325_50aaa1c6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The once lean and clean-shaven Momoa did nevertheless reprise his role for Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding in 2003, but afterwards went on to star in some of this decade’s biggest films and shows, from Game of Thrones to Dune. Momoa has a reported net worth of US$25 million today.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Mexican actress Eiza González, Jason Momoa’s new girlfriend?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2. Mariska Hargitay – US$100 million</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/24573825-8cd2-4d5d-9266-27bbb863737d_474ef17b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Law & Order: SVU actress was another of the now-famous faces to guest star in Baywatch in the early days. Hargitay appeared in the third episode in the first season as character Lisa Peters along with comedian and actor David Spade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/c60b0a5c-3e78-4fb8-a8d1-a4eee2dfdaf6_a18f5966.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, thanks to a US$450,000 per episode salary for her role as commanding officer Olivia Benson on Law & Order, which has gone on for more than two decades, Hargitay now has a reported net worth of US$100 million. Despite being the daughter of 1950s actress and sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, Hargitay’s exhaustive list of acting credits show she’s worked hard to amass her own fortune. She earns somewhere between US$13-15 million annually from Law & Order alone.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.

The Latina actress appeared in a gym scene, but the cameo was uncredited at the time.</p>Vergara has of course <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">come a long way</span></a> since then thanks to her role as Gloria Pritchett in hit sitcom Modern Family, which she was earning US$500,000 per episode for. Her numerous brand endorsements and licensing deals earn her 60 per cent of her enormous wealth, according to Forbes. She even landed the number one spot on Forbes’ 2020 world’s highest-paid actresses list, banking US$43 million that year.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/22/1db3b0b8-ead3-4068-88c9-0450b33e4427_2c5efca5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Colombian actress didn’t do badly from her America’s Got Talent judging gig either – the show reportedly pays her US$10 million per season according to The Things.
