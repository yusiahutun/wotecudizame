So it makes it very bonkers and zany.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kelly-ripa-shares-photos-wearing-no-makeup-after-sweating-in-gym-before-oscars.jpg><p>Last year, Kelly and Mark attended the Academy Awards with <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong>.

The American Idol host officially left Live in April 2023 and is currently gearing up to host season 42 of Wheel of Fortune. Mark took over as Kelly’s official cohost and fans can’t get enough of the couple on their TV screens each morning.</p><p>“A daily morning live talk show is nothing without its consistency and continuity,” Kelly told Entertainment Weekly of working with her husband on Live in April 2023. “And Mark provides that, not just for our audience, but for me, for our producers. And so if anybody could make me stay, it is definitely Mark.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWkqWK%2FqrzAZqqhmaKawG68x6irqKtdrLKivsinnmamn2K6orfErqdmmZapsrN50rCcmqyZo7Rutc1mnrKlXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
