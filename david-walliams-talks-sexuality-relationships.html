The TV personality was married to model <a class=hm-link href=#>Lara Stone</a> between 2010 and 2015 and they share a six-year-old son, Alfred, together. <strong>David has addressed questions on his sexuality several times in the past, most recently in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Attitude magazine</a> in 2017.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0bbeab7f2b9c-lara-stone-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=erSOqPi49MMB data-wc=7><strong>David Walliams and his ex-wife Lara Stone</strong></p><p id=e36E0dGTV4Ms data-wc=69>When asked if he is attracted to men, the star replied: "It's a bit of both. I don't know why anyone would rule [a relationship with a man] out. Why would anyone say that's never going to happen?" He added: <strong>"I do love women and I'm attracted to women but sometimes I think it would be simpler if I wasn't - because people think I'm gay and I'm camp."&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eFpBGuIx1yBr data-wc=32>In the same year, David told : <strong>"I had gay experiences growing up, which I enjoyed. I was a teen and in a lot of all-male environments. I am naturally very camp."</strong></p><p id=e9VLsTj9M5if data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Inside the Britain's Got Talent judges' fabulous houses</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c0c40a341f8-britains-got-talent-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e6uRUfMnVVf5 data-wc=5><strong>David with his BGT co-stars</strong></p><p id=eyje2UBQKicG data-wc=33>David, 48, previously told the <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Radio Times</a></strong> how he believes that sexuality can change over the years. He said: "I think it's all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really."</p><p id=e1P371XBxqEE data-wc=58>He continued: <strong>"I hate it when people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. </strong>You don't just fall in love with someone's body, do you? You fall in love with someone's soul and heart and brain."</p><p id=ec6hsNGg6Kse data-wc=59>In a 2009 appearance on , host Kirsty Young asked the comedian: "Have you ever had a relationship with a man?" He replied: "No. If I fell in love with a man then, yeah, I wouldn't say that could never happen. I think about it; because I am effeminate I've always thought about it, 'Am I gay?'"</p><p id=e6vKvy-QDTRQ data-wc=43>&nbsp;He also revealed: "If I was gay, I would just get on with it. But definitely I love women, <strong>I love being around women, I find them incredible and intoxicating, and I've never had that feeling I get with women with a man."</strong></p><p id=eL6nu6__Ucb4 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRaWdyamZuhHp%2FlWibmq6ZmXq4rculoJqlo2LBorjKrGSsnaiqrq2107Jkq52clsGqu82sn6Koo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
