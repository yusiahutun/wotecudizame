Earlier this year, the Heber City, Utah, resident posted a video of her 11-year-old daughter, Lydia, playing a song on her guitar and singing to her toddler, Bo, who has Down syndrome. While Bo has a vocabulary of about 12 words now, he could sing along to&nbsp;certain words&nbsp;of&nbsp;"You Are My Sunshine" with his sister.</p><p>The heartwarming clip has Lydia pausing on specific words as her young brother sings along. At one point, he&nbsp;is seen dancing to the song as he attempts to grab her guitar. The video has amassed over 2 million views on YouTube.</p><p>"My daughter Lydia was watching Bo while I was in the shower," Gray captions the three-minute clip. "Came out to this. If she didn’t have a guitar I don’t know if she would know how to babysit him. This is her go to. It’s proof that music therapy works. Bo is 25 months old and has a 12 word vocabulary. Every word he has learned has been through music and singing."</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>ABC News</a>, Gray says doctors told her not to expect her son to talk until he was 3 years old. Music has helped him defy those odds. In addition to Down syndrome, Bo was born with several heart and lung conditions and has spent&nbsp;a lot of time in hospitals undergoing treatment. When the family was given permission to bring a guitar into his room to sing to him, Lydia noticed he could say the word "happy."</p><p>"After weeks and weeks (which ended up in months) of being in the hospital in a silent room of the CICU (Cardiac Intensive Care Unit) we got special permission to bring a guitar in and sing to him in hopes that it would comfort him," the mother shared.</p><p>"We feel like he's defying the odds," Gray later told ABC News. "Thanks to Lydia and her determination, she pushed forward with music therapy. ... We're so proud of our kids."</p><p><strong>Luke Bryan's 8-Year-Old Dance Partner Is Melting Hearts</strong></p><p><strong>Here&nbsp;Are the 100 Best&nbsp;Country Albums of the 2000s:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrKGjqbKzedKipaCrXa68tnnAq5xmpaliwLa60qGgp51dl7%2BwwMeeqWacn6y7br%2FYp5urp52afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
