The founder herself saw the humble beginnings of the&nbsp; brand in her early years when she trained in the art of creating good face creams. This artistry and passion led to Estee Lauder becoming a go-to for those who always put skincare first. Some of the best Estee Lauder products are admired and celebrated for their velvety textures, luxurious fragrances, and delicately subtle yet balanced feel for varied skin types.</p><p>Talking more about the brand, Estée Lauder founded her company in 1946, launching only four skincare products. The next year, the brand’s sales grew by leaps and bounds after it fetched an order of $800 from Saks Fifth Avenue. And now, needless to say that the skincare-infused makeup brand enjoys a cult following around the globe.</p><p>Skincare aficionados are always curious to find out more about the active ingredients when it comes to skincare products. Estee Lauder, in a similar vein, has vitamin C, peptides and retinol as the core ingredients that make the building blocks of their skincare range. <a href=#><u>Vitamin C is touted as a strong anti-aging agent</u></a>, whereas peptides and retinol both focus on being absorbed deep into the layers of the skin, thereby making it more supple, firm and smooth. With such rockstar ingredients packing a punch, it is but only right to add the suffix ‘best’ to Estee Lauder products. So if you’ve been looking for skincare products that give your skin the movie-star finish, then you’ve come to the right place! Scroll down to take a look at our top product recommendations.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>15 Best Estee Lauder Products</h2></p><p>Night-time serums have a primary role to play in the entire skincare regime, which is to allow the skin to fully replenish and recover. And if there’s one serum that does this best, then it would be the Advanced Night Repair Recovery Complex. It can be used by anyone and everyone regardless of their skin type mainly due to its intensely hydrating qualities and the exclusive ChronoluxCB™ technology that it comes packed with. The result?
