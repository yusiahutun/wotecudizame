In fact, he recently married the love of his May Oyola in April 2022.</span></p><p><span>So, who is she? Keep reading this Oyola Bio to learn all about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet May Oyola, Teen Mom 2 Star Nathan Griffith Wife</b></h3><p><span>It was May 2022 when Nathan Griffith first revealed that he married a woman named May Oyola v.i.a. a (now-deleted) FB post. Though the post was soon removed, fans were quick to screenshot it, and upon further research “Heavy.com” found that the pair exchanged vows back on April 15, 2022, in Miami-Dade County, Florida.</span></p><p><span>The news about May and Nathan’s wedding comes about 7 years after Nathan’s brief engagement to Janelle Evans in 2015. To viewers’ dismay, </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span> stars didn’t end up officially tying the knot.</span></p><p><span>Also, prior to the split, the couple looked the happiest. “I was completely shocked. I think I had an idea he would probably propose to me here, but I didn’t know when during the week he was going to do it. And I didn’t know what was going to happen or anything. So it was like expected, but unexpected,” Janelle back then shared her happiness after the engagement.</span></p><p><span>But Janelle was the only girl in Nathan’s life before he married May Oyola. Initially, he was married to Alison Stevens, the mother of his daughter Emory.</span></p><p><span>Then came Janelle, and after ending his courtship with her, Nathan briefly dated Jessica Henry and then Ashley Lanhardt for several years before splitting around the end of 2020.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Nathan has met over 5 lovers in his life, two of whom gave him a baby.</span></p><p><span>His kids are — Kaiser Griffith (from his relationship with Jenelle) and JeEmery Griffith (from his relationship with Allison).</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, though Nathan didn’t get along with Jenelle and her husband David Eason, he visited their home every other weekend to meet his son.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Nathan was still on Tinder not too long age before marrying May.</span></p><h3><b>May Oyola Age</b></h3><p><span>May Oyola was likely born after 1990.

However, we can confirm that the “May Oyola” on the given link isn’t the May we’re looking for, and surely her job isn’t engineering.</span></p><p><span>In case you want to know about the speculated May’s career, she is a P</span><i><span>enn State University</span></i><span> electrical engineering graduate who joined </span><i><span>General Motors</span></i><span> as an intern in May 2018 before officially starting her job as a “controls engineer” 4 months later.</span></p><p><span>Also, she’s worked as a team member at </span><i><span>Jamba Juice</span></i><span>, gift shop cashier at Minerals </span><i><span>Resort and Spa</span></i><span>, and sales associate at </span><i><span>Mountain Creek Resort</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Nathan is a personal trainer who’s been contract freelancing for over 6 years. This </span><i><span>Athens High School</span></i><span> graduate initially started his career in July 2006 as a part of “Infantry 0311” at the </span><i><span>U.S. Marine Corps</span></i><span>. Retiring exactly 4 years later, Nathan then joined </span><i><span>Travel + Leisure Co.</span></i><span> as a “frontliner” and in 2016 he briefly became a running-back at </span><i><span>American Indoor Football Association</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>However, it wasn’t until Jan 2014 that Nathan stepped into the limelight as a reality star, all thanks to </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span>. He first appeared on the MTV documentary series on its ep 2 titled “Love Will Never Do Without You.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, Jenelle had just terminated her pregnancy and she finds emotional shelter in a new guy she had just stumbled upon, Nathan.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Nathan was charged with a misdemeanor and other minor ordinances, which was featured on </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span>. On the show, he was advised by his lawyers to accept a plea deal in order to dismiss a felony charge against him. Because of this, things also got pretty heated up between Nathan and Jenelle.</span></p><h3><b>Is May Oyola On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>As of 2022, May Oyola had kept her Instagram private.
