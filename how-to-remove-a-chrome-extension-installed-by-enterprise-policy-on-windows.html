In most cases, anybody that's part of an enterprise, business, school, workplace, etc., will have a system administrator who manages these types of settings and extensions on your machine.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Does Chrome Say It's "Managed By Your Organization?"</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, if you aren't part of an enterprise, or don't have an administrator who manages your computer, these extensions can find other ways onto your system and grant themselves elevated status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You see, sometimes when you download free software from the internet, it can come with an added piece of bonus&nbsp;software that isn't adequately disclosed (or technically was but in a misleading TOS) when running the installer---this is commonly known as adware or malware. The unwanted software embeds itself into your list of browser extensions, and you don't realize it until Chrome redirects to some shady looking website or pops up annoying ads.</p><p>These extensions leverage a Chrome policy that's intended for system administrators but sometimes exploited by malware, which gives it immunity from being removed from your browser via Google Chrome's extensions page. To remove an extension "Installed by Enterprise Policy," you need to find and delete the policy that this harmful extension added.</p><p>If you suspect the extension to be malicious, the first order of operation should be to run <a href=#>antimalware software</a> to see if it can search and destroy the problem automatically for you. Otherwise, continue below and follow the steps listed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Run Malwarebytes Alongside Another Antivirus</a></span></p><h2 id=how-to-remove-an-installed-by-enterprise-policy-extension>How to Remove an&nbsp;"Installed by Enterprise Policy" Extension</h2><p>Extensions like this can often---but, unfortunately, not always---be removed by modifying the Windows registry. Here's how.</p><p>First, fire up Chrome, type <code>chrome://extensions</code> into&nbsp;the&nbsp;Omnibox, and then hit Enter.</p><p>At the top of the page, toggle the switch that reads "Developer Mode" to the "On" position. This lets you view a bit more information about each extension that we need for the steps below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-04-06_14h45_19.png><p>Scroll down until you find the extension added by policy---look for the one you can't remove normally from the Extensions page.

So, be on the lookout for any extensions that prevent you from clicking the Remove button.</p><p>To remove an&nbsp;"Installed by Policy" Extension, you need to make a few edits in the Windows Registry.</p><p><strong>Standard Warning:</strong>&nbsp;Registry Editor is a powerful tool and misusing it can render your system unstable or even inoperable.
