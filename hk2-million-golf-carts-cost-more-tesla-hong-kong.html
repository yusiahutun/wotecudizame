Outrageously high prices aren’t an oddity in Hong Kong. Asia’s financial capital regularly appears on lists of the world’s most expensive cities, and property prices are the world’s most unaffordable relative to income."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Private passenger cars aren’t allowed in this neighbourhood, and the Transport Department has capped golf-cart licenses at about 500. The supply crunch has transformed these slow gas-guzzlers into luxury transportation. Some buyers view them as investments – renting them out or reselling to make money.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Outrageously high prices aren’t an oddity in Hong Kong. Asia’s financial capital regularly appears on lists of the world’s most expensive cities, and property prices are the world’s most unaffordable relative to income. Faced with rock-bottom interest rates and soaring housing prices, city residents have been known to put their money into unusual investments – including high-priced parking lots and taxi medallions.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You have HK$2 million, better buy a golf buggy rather than put it in the bank,” says Bill Chan, a director at real-estate agency Century 21 Newcourt Realty in Discovery Bay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Golf carts can be bought for less than US$10,000 in the US. In Discovery Bay, buyers are essentially paying for the licenses, which can only be owned by residents who also own property. They can be freely traded between individual owners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That leads to prices typically associated with luxury wheels – the kinds that include windows, air conditioning and a trunk. Tesla&nbsp;lists&nbsp;its Model S at HK$1.03 million, and Porsche lists its 718 Boxster model at HK$972,000 on its&nbsp;website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Golf carts attract buyers partly because of the punishing cost of real-estate investments in Hong Kong: There isn’t much you can buy in the property market if you have HK$2 million to spare.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Private homes in Discovery Bay&nbsp; sell from&nbsp; HK$8 million to HK$80 million, said Denis Ma,head of research for Hong Kong at real-estate services company Jones Lang LaSalle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His firm estimates that prices in Hong Kong’s Central and Western districts start from HK$5 million for smaller apartments in older buildingsand going up to about HK$1 billion for houses on The Peak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Discovery Bay residents are generally reluctant to publicise their outlays on golf carts. One expatriate shopper, who walked out of a supermarket to dump groceries into the back of her golf buggy, declined to give her name. She and her husband paid about HK$600,000 when they bought it more than a decade ago, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They weighed the convenience of driving their&nbsp; children and the investment potential. Property prices were soaring, and they concluded that its value could only go up. And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though it’s like driving a lawnmower, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The area’s developer, Hong Kong Resort, says it explored various options before deciding that golf carts would be the best fit for Discovery Bay’s positioning as a town with the environment of a resort. In recent years, it’s introduced electric golf carts. Only holders of valid driving licenses are allowed to take the buggies on the roads.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Katie Jepson, one of the owners of real-estate seller Headland Homes, said she’s seen cart sales increase&nbsp;after the government introduced higher stamp duties, a&nbsp;property tax intended to cool the real-estate market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If they’ve got an extra HK$2.5 million, instead of buying a small apartment you have to pay stamp duty on, people have been buying some golf carts,” Jepson says. Carts can earn monthly rents of HK$8,000 to HK$10,000, she estimates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That means renting a golf cart can cost more than a “nano” flat. These&nbsp; tiny apartments, less than 200 square feet in size, cost&nbsp; from HK$8,000 a to HK$12,000 a month to rent, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even so, there’s risk in pouring money into a pokey vehicle built primarily for a round of golf. The buggies are far from a necessity, and there’s no guarantee prices will stay high because residents have alternatives like biking or internal shuttle buses, said David Ji,head of research&nbsp; and consultancy for Greater China at real-estate research firm Knight Frank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People trying to bet on this going on forever strikes me as risky,” Ji says. “At the end of the day, you speculate on a house and the house price drops, you still have a house.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Manufactured by companies including US-based&nbsp;Textron&nbsp;and Japan’s Yamaha Motor Co., the golf carts&nbsp; remain an unshakeable staple of life in Discovery Bay,&nbsp; and its population of about 20,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They putter past tennis courts, beach-side eateries and apartment blocks. In rush hour, big commuter buses heading towards the ferry pier often get stuck behind one and can’t pass. Children and dogs are typical passengers, and they’re used by handymen to lug tools around.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan, the real-estate agent, recalls the carts selling for as little as HK$35,000 in the 1980s, when he was starting out in Discovery Bay. In more recent years, he estimates, they’ve tended to sell&nbsp;from HK$2.1 million to HK$2.3 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is Hong Kong,” the real estate agent shrugs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
