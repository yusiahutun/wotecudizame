In her caption, she expressed her enthusiasm, saying, "It’s a new soundtrack! Here are the back covers and vault track titles for 1989 (my version). I can’t wait for this one to be out, seriously. Thank you for playing along, sleuthing, puzzling, and making these reveals so much chaotic fun (which is the best kind of fun, after all).” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The surprise track titles are as follows: Is It Over Now?, Say Don’t Go, Now That We Don’t Talk, and Suburban Legends. But that's not all—there's a fifth track yet to be named, and a Target-exclusive track that is still under wraps. So far, there has not been any collaboration in name. Thus, most of the tracks in the album seem to be Taylor Swift's vocals.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><h2><strong>1989 Taylor's Version: Release date and more to know</strong></h2><p>The release date for '1989 (Taylor's Version)' is set for Friday, October 27, 2023, as announced by Swift herself on Instagram. In her post, she expressed her excitement about this re-record, especially the inclusion of five vault tracks that were never officially released. The tracklist for the album includes all 16 songs from the original deluxe version of '1989.' Additionally, those who opt for the exclusive 'Tangerine' vinyl version will enjoy an extra bonus track.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>This re-recording is part of Taylor Swift's mission to regain control of her master recordings, following disputes and ownership changes involving her early catalog. It's a way for her to maintain creative ownership and offer her fans a fresh take on her beloved classics. All updates from the world of pop culture will be served right here. Thus, keep an eye on Pinkvilla for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2Bprrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8Fuwc2vnKKko2J%2BeoSYZquasZykv7R51Z6prKGfo3qnwculZK%2BZpaHBbrjIrKtmrKKWsKy4yKyrZqqVobKiv8Rmm5qslWKur7CMpqarnV2pvG63zaiuZmliaYF4fZA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
