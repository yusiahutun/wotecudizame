Joe Jonas and <a href=#>Sophie Turner</a> split after “four wonderful years of marriage,” and two kids in September.</p><p>The exact reasoning is unknown, however, in their <a href=#>joint statement</a>, they shut down any “speculative narratives.” One of these involves claims of the TV star saying something on the ring doorbell cam, but whether there’s any truth to this, or what was said, remains unknown.</p><p>As for a reconciliation, well it looks unlikely as the GOT star looks to have <a href=#>moved on with Pergereine Pearson</a>. Although it doesn’t seem like they’re official just yet.</p><p><a href=#>Joe Jonas</a> on the other hand seems to be chilling with his brothers on tour, and overtaking <a href=#>TikTok</a>. But we’re sure his DM requests are flooded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-longest-celeb-breakup-of-2023-hugh-jackman-and-deborra-lee-furness>Longest celeb breakup of 2023 – Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1486978551-1024x683.jpg><p>After <a href=#>27 years of marriage</a>, there wasn’t anyone who wasn’t shocked about this one. That’s longer than Sophie Turner has been on this earth!</p><p>Again, the long-standing former couple didn’t state an exact reason, but said their “journey was shifting”.</p><p>“We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth,” they said in their sole <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> to PEOPLE.</p><p><a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> has been sighted after the split and hanging out with friends Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively in New York.

However, to public knowledge, it looks like there’s no bad blood between the two and their lifestyles just didn’t mix.</p><p>But it’s not all bad news, as she seems to have found romance again with <a href=#>Wicked co-star</a> Ethan Slater.

Just look at that adorable pic!</p><p>The pair were first spotted together in October 2022 and called it quits by May.</p><p>They often faced backlash for their 10-year age gap, however, her brother&nbsp;Finneas O’Connell&nbsp;defended the romance at the GQ&nbsp;Men of the Year party in November 2022.</p><p>“Listen, as long as she’s happy, I’m happy,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> E!

In the video, the Toxic singer told her 42 million followers she was “a little shocked” but it was “nobody’s business”.</p><p>“As everyone knows, Hesam and I are no longer together… Six years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but… I’m not here to explain why because it’s honestly nobody’s business,” she wrote.</p><p>“But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly,” she continued before thanking friends for her messages. “And actually, I’m doing pretty damn good,” she concluded.</p><p>The pair stated irreconcilable differences on the court docs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-most-recent-celeb-breakup-of-2023-cardi-b-and-offset>Most recent celeb breakup of 2023 – Cardi B and Offset</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1678674475-1024x683.jpg><p>The most recent celeb breakup in 2023 comes from music stars Cardi B and Offset.
