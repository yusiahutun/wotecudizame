Famed for its bright white sands and striking rock formations, the cast of Outer Banks actually headed to Bathsheba Beach in Barbados to film these particular scenes – and we couldn't be more jealous.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c60cab9ab63-outer-banks-bathsheba-beach-z.jpg><p id=eZI7bDqSS4VB data-wc=10><strong>Bathsheba Beach in Barbados is the filming location for 'Poguelandia'&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e8oxkS4zfmh5 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 brilliant shows and films coming to Netflix in March</a></strong></p><p id=e5lI9nEbmL8_ data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Outer Banks fans have major complaint over 'annoying' season three plot</a></strong></p><h3 dir=ltr>Lowndes Grove Estate, Charleston</h3><p id=e3boqKQCFFhm data-wc=75>Before she became an honourary Pogue, Sarah Cameron was described as a 'Kook Princess' for her affluent lifestyle at Tanneyhill Plantation. A real-life 18th-century estate, the Cameron's home is actually called <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Lowndes Grove</a>, and it's distinguished on the National Register for Historic Places. Based in Charleston, in between filming for Outer Banks, the estate is used as a popular wedding and private events venue, thanks to its 1786-era architecture and sweeping views of the Ashley River.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/249b782b5182-sarah-cameron-home-z.jpg><p id=eQ1M-xaJ14gS data-wc=15><strong>Sarah Cameron's family home is actually an 18th-century estate which is now used for weddings</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr>Morris Island Lighthouse, South Carolina</h3><p id=e3tPCk7mEY9I data-wc=70>Throwing it back to the first season, you might remember the Pogues' trip to the fictional Redfield Lighthouse after discovering a major clue. In reality, it was an exterior shot of the lighthouse on Morris Island in South Carolina that was featured in the episode, and the island itself is actually rumoured to be haunted. According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Coastal Expeditions</a>, Morris Island is haunted by both Civil War soldiers and shipwrecked passengers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc3b8babaf69-outer-banks-morris-island-lighthouse-z.jpg><p id=egm6KhySLo1m data-wc=12><strong>Morris Island Lighthouse features as&nbsp;the fictional Redfield Lighthouse in season one</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr>Geechie Seafood, Shem Creek in Mount Pleasant</h3><p id=eY6Qn8_aQQVJ data-wc=39>Doubling up as a hangout spot for the Pogues, Geechie Seafood is a real fresh seafood market based along Shem Creek in Mount Pleasant – but for Outer Banks fans, it's best known as Poe's father's business, Heyward's Seafood.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Charleston Gaillard Center</h3><p id=elXBxvWDo2hH data-wc=49>During season one, sparks fly between John B and Sarah while taking a trip to the Chapel Hill Law Library at the University of North Carolina. Behind the scenes, however, it was the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Charleston Gaillard Center</a> that was used in scenes. It's currently used to host music, dance, comedy and theatre performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68973bf215d2-charleston-galliard-center-z.jpg><p id=e_pT9UgnSZAx data-wc=14><strong>The Chapel Hill Law Library in season one is actually the&nbsp;Charleston Gaillard Center</strong></p><p id=eWjuDxikSXpB data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a>&nbsp;to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2trYGh%2BcX2Vb2pybV%2BkwrWx0WaZmqabqHqntcumoKefXaG8pK3Toqanq12nsrexwKWcnWWSlr%2BjrcOoqmabmJa%2FrbHSraanZZGjsW65zqucaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
