No, the two aren’t dating. However, the <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1630823/how-to-watch-us-open-2023/ rel="noreferrer noopener">basketball player</a> wants to see the tennis player win every game. “She’s a champion and I love that she’s from the city that I work in,” he told ESPN while he was in the stands. “I just love to be here to support her. So, I want her to win every single time.”</p><p>When she lost at Wimbledon in the first round, she found solace in Jimmy’s sportsmanship when eyeing for the US Open. “That switch I had in the last couple weeks. people think some incredible thing happened,” she said after winning the third round of the U.S. Open on Tuesday with a dominant 6-3, 6-2 rout of Russian Mirra Andreeva at Arthur Ashe Stadium., according to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>New York Daily News</a>. “But realistically, the two weeks between Wimbledon and the next tournament I played, nothing could have really changed that much. It was really just the mental thing. I think that’s what I learned from watching Jimmy compete over the years.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The 19-year-old tennis prodigy also treasured the familial relationship between the athletes. “Him and my mom spoke for a long time when he was here. …He was like, yeah, he can really see the joy in me again in playing and enjoying the competition, and that I should continue to do that,” Gauff said. “I learned a lot watching him, everybody counting him out. … You have people that are talented and don’t have the mentality. He has the talent and the mentality.</p><p>“That’s something I learned from [him]. Honestly, that’s part of the reason I’d say that switch I had in the last couple weeks. People think some incredible thing happened, but realistically two weeks between Wimbledon and the next tournament I played, nothing could’ve really changed that much. It was really just the mental thing. That’s what I learned from watching Jimmy compete.”</p><p>When the Miami heat went to the NBA Playoffs, Gauff was sad to not be in attendance. “I said: ‘I won’t be here. I’ll be in Madrid and then Rome and then France,’” Gauff told reporters. “And then he said: ‘OK, when we make the Finals, let me know if your family wants some tickets.’ So this was before [the Heat] were even in the playoffs.</p><p>She revealed what words stuck with her when winning those competitions. “This is before we lost to the Hawks for the first Play-In game. Everybody is like we have a 3% chance of making the Finals, but when he sent me that, I knew we were making the Finals because he didn’t say, ‘If we make the Finals,’ he said: ‘When we make the Finals.’ Now that we are in the Finals, I can say that story.”</p><p>“But I remember screenshotting it and sending it to my family and I was, like: ‘Oh, we’re going to the Finals!’” On why it stuck with her, she added, “I just really like that mentality of him.”</p><p>On whether she wants to follow the tennis GOAT<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1628950/serena-williams-second-baby-name/ rel="noreferrer noopener"> Serena Williams</a>‘s footsteps, Gauff told People that&nbsp;there’s “a little bit less pressure in a way because she is the greatest player of all time.” However, she’s “not trying to fulfill those footsteps whatsoever. But obviously I do want to be the best version of myself and be the best that I can be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jimmy-butler-coco-gauf.jpg><p>Gauff made headlines during a round of the US Open when she called out an umpire who was lenient to her opponent <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1630995/coco-gauff-umpire/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura Siegemund.</a></p><p>After Gauff held a 3-0 lead in the final set Gauff protested when Siegemund put her arms up to signal that she wasn’t quite ready for Gauff’s serve and the umpire honored her request. “She’s never ready when I’m serving, she went over to talk like four times, you only gave her a time violation once, how is this fair?” Gauff said. “No, you’re calling the score after the point is over, it’s not like we’re playing long points. You’re calling the score like six seconds after the point is over!”</p><p>She continued: “You have missed her like four times. She’s never ready! It’s not like we’re having, like 30-ball rallies. It’s two balls…I’m going at a normal speed! Ask any ref here, I go at a medium-pace speed,” Gauff said. “She can’t [go back] every single point. And everybody in this crowd knows I’ve been quiet this whole match…That first set, it was like every point. I didn’t say nothing, but now it’s ridiculous. I don’t care what she’s putting on her serves, on my serves she has to be ready.”</p><p>Gauff reflected on the confrontation later on Twitter: “If I could do it all over again, I would’ve said something earlier, maybe on a changeover.. other than that I don’t regret talking to the ref the way I did. I actually watched the video when I was taking an ice bath bc I wanted to make sure before I came in here. Sometimes you have these emotions & you forget what you said. I’d still say everything I said in that moment again,” she wrote. &nbsp;</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
