Not only did she open the <span><strong>Victoria's Secret Fashion Show held in London last December</strong></span>, but she has since gone on to star in the brand's Super Bowl advert earlier this year, as well as joining nine other models to star in the brand's annual Swim catalogue. Talking exclusively to <strong>HELLO! Fashion</strong> backstage at the show, Behati revealed that she had been extremely nervous about being the first to take to the catwalk. "It's so amazing and so stressful all at the same time," she said. "It's such a huge moment that I will always be nervous." Earlier this year, fellow angels <a class=hm-link href=#>Karlie Kloss and Doutzen Kroes shocked the industry after it was revealed just days apart that they will be leaving Victoria's Secret to pursue other projects</a>. However, there are clearly no hard feelings, with the brand's President and chief marketing officer Ed Razek describing Karlie as 'one of the best models ever' and Doutzen as 'one of the most stunningly beautiful people in the world'.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria’s Secret Fabulous Campaign: On Set with Behati Prinsloo</a><p id=e0TpoGzhiX3W data-wc=18></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
