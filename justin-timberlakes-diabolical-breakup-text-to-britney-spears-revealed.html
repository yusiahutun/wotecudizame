That’s a good idea.

That was me then…. That is in the past!! I don’t like the headlines I am reading, that’s why I quit the business 4 years ago.”</p><p>The star then explained her book was from ’20 years ago’ and she has now moved on to a “beautiful clean slate.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2d%2FcLbUrKuipl2ptq6uxKujmqOVqHqltcCbpqWhk5a5bq7RnpikraBiwabE02arqGWSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnRnq2emZyasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
