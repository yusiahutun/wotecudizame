You can review almost any location, from a local business to a hiking trail or historical landmark. All you need is a Google account.</p><h2 id=is-my-personal-information-exposed-to-the-public>Is My Personal Information Exposed to the Public?</h2><p>Google doesn't allow anonymous reviews, which means that some of your personal information will be available to the public. This information includes your name and profile picture (which appear on your Google Account's <a href=#>About Me</a> page), other reviews, photos, and videos that you've left, and the location information of those reviews.</p><p>This means, of course, that people can see your name, along with all of the locations you've reviewed. If that matters to you at all, you'll need to be cautious about the reviews that you leave and the language that you use when leaving the review.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-leave-a-google-review-on-your-computer>How to Leave a Google Review on Your Computer</h2><p>To leave a Google Review on your Mac or Windows 10 PC, open the browser of your choice, visit the <a href=#>Google Maps website,</a> and sign in to your Google account if you haven't already.</p><p>Next, enter the name or address of the location that you'd like to search for in the search box located in the top-left corner of the browser.

This can be as short or as long as you like since Google doesn't set a word count for Google Reviews.
