It has the power to captivate our hearts, mend broken souls, and create lasting connections. One band that has masterfully explored the depths of love in their music is INXS. With their unique blend of rock and pop, INXS showcases the many facets of love in their lyrics, delving into both its euphoric and tumultuous aspects. In this article, we will dive into the rich and profound theme of love as found in the lyrics of INXS, examining specific examples from their remarkable discography.One of the most iconic tracks that encapsulates the theme of love is "Never Tear Us Apart" from their 1987 album "Kick." Right from the opening lines, the lyrics paint a vivid picture of an unwavering love, with phrases like "Don't ask me, what you know is true, don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart." These heartfelt words express a deep connection that cannot be broken, as if love itself is an unwavering force. The song continues to explore the idea of love's strength, with lines like "But if I hurt you, I'll make wine from your tears, I'll tell you, you're all that I need." These lines reveal an unconditional love that is willing to heal and grow even in the face of adversity.Another example of INXS delving into the theme of love can be found in the song "Need You Tonight" from their 1987 album. This track showcases a passionate and fiery love, as seen in the lyrics "All you got is this moment, twenty-first century's yesterday, you can care all you want, everybody does yeah, that's okay." These lines highlight the intensity of love, emphasizing that in love, the present moment is all that matters. The lyrics also allude to a universal truth that everyone yearns for love, acknowledging that it is a fundamental human need.Moving on to the track "Beautiful Girl" from their 1992 album "Welcome to Wherever You Are," INXS explores the complexities of love. The lyrics in this song touch upon the notion of love's ability to empower and elevate, with phrases like "You're my inspiration, girl, you're the power behind what makes me strong." INXS captures the idea that love has the transformative power to inspire and fuel personal growth. The song also reflects on the vulnerability that comes with love, as evident in the lyrics "And life is a tangled web, of insecurity, a long fight to love yourself, could not demand for something else."Shifting to a more somber and reflective tone, INXS's song "Afterglow" from their 1997 album "Elegantly Wasted" explores the concept of love in the aftermath of loss. The lyrics beautifully depict the mourning of a lost love, with phrases like "Whispered tears too sad for lies, blinded by the lies in your eyes." These lines portray the pain and heartbreak that can accompany the loss of love, making one feel deceived and lost. However, the chorus of the song offers a glimmer of hope, acknowledging that even in the darkest moments, love can still leave an afterglow.In addition to these specific examples, INXS's vast discography is replete with songs that explore love in all its forms. Songs like "By My Side," "Devil Inside," and "Original Sin" also delve into the intricacies of love, further enriching the band's exploration of this universal theme.In conclusion, INXS's lyrics beautifully express the multifaceted nature of love. From the euphoria of a never-ending bond to the complexities of loss and vulnerability, their music captures the essence of love in all its shades. Through their unique blend of rock and pop, INXS has created a body of work that resonates deeply with listeners, evoking emotions and memories associated with love.
