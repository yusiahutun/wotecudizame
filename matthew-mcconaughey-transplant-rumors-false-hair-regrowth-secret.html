He shared that picture in his memoir "Greenlights" -- and LADBible shared that page in their story.</p><p>So how is it that McConaughey has such a full head of hair all these years later? "How did it grow back? That's a great mystery," McConaughey laughed.</p><p>Despite rumors and speculation that the actor went in for a hair transplant at one point, McConaughey insists that wasn't the case at all. Instead, he said it was all about a topical ointment and commitment.</p><p>The buzzed head was actually part of the process, too, as McConaughey had heard that a "fresh start" was the best thing to try and stimulate new hair growth. But in the end it just came down to dedication and putting in the work.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:33fad132-6469-44f2-9478-1f0e16fde5fc data-container-ref=toofab:article:387ad848-0c5c-4728-b80f-79abfbaa1479 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e8/5by4/2020/05/24/e89aa55f8b6f44e4b3b90b3c89633448_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Cheyenne Jackson Admits to Five Hair Transplant Surgeries, Shows Off Massive 'Gnarly Scar'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I get this topical ointment and I rub it into my scalp, once a day for 10 minutes," he explained. "I was fully committed, I was fully committed to it - no Propecia, no nothing, it was just manual labour."</p><p>So how did it work? McConaughey doesn't quite know that, or even exactly what worked. "All I can tell you is it came back," he said. "I have more hair now than I had in 1999."</p><p>And he's stuck to his regiment, too, for nearly two decades now. "I'm not gonna quit to see if like, 'Oh, do I need to do it anymore?'. I'm not taking that chance," he laughed.</p><p>The rumors that McConaughey had taken the Hollywood route of just springing for a hair transplant gained so much traction that it even began circulating in the transplant doctor community.</p><p>McConaughey shared that he ran into a renowned doctor who told him one surgeon in particular had begun taking credit for the actor's thicker head of hair over the past several years.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7e371042-27cd-42c1-ae0c-219294e05554 data-container-ref=toofab:article:387ad848-0c5c-4728-b80f-79abfbaa1479 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/91/5by4/2022/03/02/91d0c36214d342b9b106703e3a735ab4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bob Odenkirk Was Bankrupt Before Breaking Bad: 'I Somehow Got in This Financial Hole'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As such, the doctor asked McConaughey if he could run his fingers through his hair to check out the guy's story. "He goes, 'Can I just look at your hair? Can I just feel it and see?'" McConaughey recalled.</p><p>"I said 'Yeah man,'" McConaughey continued. "He goes 'You don't have transplants,' I said 'That's what I said, of course I don't.'"</p><p>Hilariously, the doctor then told the actor he couldn't wait to "bust this guy's nut" at the next convention when he raises his hand to talk about his amazing work on McConaughey's head.</p><p>It would be so much better if McConaughey were able to be there at that exact moment to really put the surgeon on the spot.</p><a id=gallery-link-9fa82e7d-338d-4edd-aea9-891ec2bef620 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9fa82e7d-338d-4edd-aea9-891ec2bef620 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:387ad848-0c5c-4728-b80f-79abfbaa1479 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/4by3/2022/02/28/a15789b8bdd84ee58ed0e52becf51dd5_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xmaWpfoq61wMeermalk5i8r63UoJ%2BesV2pv6K60qmjmqakYr%2B2uc6rqmaekaHApnnHmqCrZaKatLO71q2fZquVmL%2BmwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
