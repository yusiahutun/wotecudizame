Gone are the restaurant’s dark, heavy wood accents and low ceiling; it’s now light, sleek and attractive, with sliding doors dividing the main area from several private dining rooms.
The restaurant still specialises in hotpot, although we didn’t see their excellent and extensive ingredients for the mix-your-own sauce."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We decided to order cooked dishes, to see what the kitchen was capable of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The menu lists both Sichuan and Guangdong dishes, and we ordered some from both parts of the menu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sautéed green chillies in vinegar (HK$68) were just fantastic. The mild chillies had been blistered in the pan, giving them a light smoky flavour, before being drizzled with chilli oil and black beans. It looked fiery, but was actually mild enough so the chilli-phobe in my group could eat it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We also ordered a dumpling dish as a starter: wonton in garlic chilli sauce (HK$98). They were plump, with thin skins and lots of juicy filling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/09/1851e200-0b28-11e8-a09e-8861893b1b1a_1320x770_173040.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The menu lists several fish head preparations, so we ordered it pan-fried in Shunde style (HK$198). This was one of our favourite dishes of the night. Served in a clay pot which retained the heat, the fish had a coating that was delicately crisp, and the bony pieces had lots of textures: tender flesh, jellylike collagen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We pre-ordered the baked chicken with hua tiao wine (HK$280 for half, HK$560 for whole). The meat was tender and mild, with the subtle taste of the wine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only dish we disliked was steamed minced beef with tangerine peel (HK$188). The beef patty was too thin, the meat was minced too finely, and we thought we could detect tenderiser such as baking soda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/09/8d81e19c-0b28-11e8-a09e-8861893b1b1a_1320x770_173040.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wok-fried string beans with minced pork and chilli (HK$148) was a good version of the dish, with shrivelled string beans and plenty of flavour from the other ingredients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the list of autumn and winter dishes, we chose the fried glutinous rice with preserved meat (HK$238). It was served at about the same time as all the other dishes, even though, as a rice dish, it should have come last. It was cold by the time we were ready to eat it, so we asked for it to be reheated because cold glutinous rice is unappetising. It came back to us piping hot, and was delicious: the grains of rice were distinct, and flavoured with the rich fat from the Chinese sausage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/09/3ac16946-0b28-11e8-a09e-8861893b1b1a_1320x770_173040.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Service could be better. It took time to wave down the staff, and we had to ask for our plates to be changed so the sauces from the stronger flavours wouldn’t obliterate those from the more subtle dishes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Golden Valley, 1/F, The Emperor Hotel, 373 Queen’s Road East, Wan Chai, tel: 2961 3330. About HK$400 without drinks or the service charge</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">While you are in the area:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9nfnR%2BlGpraJ%2BfobGmuoyvmKWkla56s7HSrZiuqpGjwW6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dmbKttcKipq6rXai2pLTUmqVmmZ6Z</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
