Everybody went to it, everybody knew who you was, and you just came for good atmosphere and good food,” said Clark.</p><p>The owners, Jim and Debra McCormick, say the restaurant has been around for more than two decades, and they love the community as much as the community loves them.</p><p>“I think we have a lot of customers that are right now more upset than us. I don’t think it’s really hit us yet, but we’ve had some customers that, like you said, are just devastated. They’ve been coming here once or twice a week for 20 years. Now, you just blink your eyes, and you can’t go there no more,” said Jim McCormick.</p><p>The McCormick’s say they got people out of the restaurant quickly, including staff who were trying to put the fire out.</p><p>“I mean you can call them staff, but they’re our friends. I mean they’re loyal and family… I mean we have awesome people that get us through each day. Some of them are really hard days, long days,” said Debra McCormick.</p><p>Now, they’re trying to figure out how to move forward.</p><p>“We’ve never been through it before, but we’ll start the process and hope for the best,” said Jim McCormick.</p><p>The owners say they are still working with the state fire&nbsp;marshal&nbsp;and their insurance company, and they are planning to rebuild.&nbsp;</p><p>Galesburg Fire was one of about 10 departments called to help fight the flames.&nbsp;</p><p>Fire crews were still on site after midnight to make sure there were no hot spots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46wmK2Zl5Z6rbvSnqpmmpWhvLexw2apnquklsKzrc2tZK2nXZu2s7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
