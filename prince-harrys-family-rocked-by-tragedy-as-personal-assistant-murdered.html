A suspect is in custody.</p><p>“Jenean was loyal, hardworking, beautiful and fun and my heart breaks for her family and friends. I heard from her just a couple of months ago and she seemed so happy. Her family is raising money to transport her body back to New York City and pay for legal and funeral costs.</p><p>“I will be making a donation and supporting the family in any way possible – please help if you can at the link in my bio.”</p><p>A GoFundMe <a href=# rel=nofollow>fundraiser</a> has already managed to raise $28,000 at time of writing, more than half way towards the $50,000 target.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of York separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. They share two daughters, <a href=#>Princess Beatrice</a> and Eugenie. Despite the split, Fergie remained close to The Firm, especially <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, before her death last year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenean-chapman-murder-investigation-opened>Jenean Chapman murder investigation opened</h2><p>Fox News affiliate, KDFW, <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> Dallas police announced she was sadly found dead in an apartment in downtown Dallas on Monday (September 25).</p><p>The next day, a medical examiner determined her cause of death as homicide.</p><p>James Patrick, who had been identified as the prime suspect, was arrested by University of Texas police, cops said.

I always look up to her as like what I wanted to accomplish in my corporate career.”</p><p>Jenean Chapman began working for the royal family after graduation. She left Syracuse University with a degree in <a href=#>TV</a>, film and production. After working for the Duchess of York, Chapman went on to work at Def Jam and the Simmons family.</p><p>Nicole added: “She was just an accomplished intellectual.</p><p>“She was a kind person and compassionate.
