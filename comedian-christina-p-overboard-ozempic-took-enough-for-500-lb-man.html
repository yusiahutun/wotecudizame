According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>prescription medication's </strong></a>website, Ozempic is described as "a medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes that, along with diet and exercise, may improve blood sugar. While not for weight loss, Ozempic may help you lose some weight."</p><p>The initial weekly dose of the medication is 0.25 mg injection, before it's increased to 0.5 mg. However, for those who need "additional control" of their blood sugar, a doctor may increase the dosage up to 2 mg a week, which is the "maximum dose" according to the website.</p><p>Per Christina P's story, she injected 10 times the amount she was prescribed.</p><a id=gallery-link-32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7a3aa03e-4137-4b01-a26f-494fde0a46a2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/4by3/2023/12/13/7cb3f58c59794b7d86a7287f42dbee28_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mampfmLyuscOimKdlk52%2Fqr%2FToqWaZaBivLex0ZummqqUYry7scypoJxlpKS8rHnEp6aun5his7C%2BjG5naWWcl3qurc1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
