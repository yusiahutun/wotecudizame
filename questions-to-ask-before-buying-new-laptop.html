So, here's our guide on the fundamental things to consider when buying a new laptop.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-your-budget>1. What's Your Budget?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-table-with-a-laptop-spreadsheets-calculator-a-wads-of-cash.jpg><p>How much you're willing to spend determines what brand-new laptops are within your reach. So, figure out how much you can spare and then focus on the laptop options within that price market. You should work towards buying the best laptop you can afford.</p><p>There are three major price brackets for new laptops: <a href=#>budget laptops with prices under $500</a>, <a href=#>mid-range laptops</a> between $500 and $1,000, and high-end laptops with price tags as high as $3,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Low-cost, budget laptops are often good enough to browse the internet, manage files, take notes, and occasionally stream movies. The mid-range options are more than good enough, offering the perfect balance of price and performance and serving as an efficient daily driver for most work or school tasks.</p><p>At the top of the pyramid sit high-end, premium, expensive laptops targeted toward professionals requiring speed and power. With these, you'll find yourself compiling code faster, encoding videos in a relatively shorter time, and gaming with barely any lag or stutter.</p><h2 id=what-do-you-want-to-use-it-for>2. What Do You Want to Use It For?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-person-using-an-acer-laptop.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before making any selection, it's worth mulling over all the things that are essential to your workflow. At a basic level, it's worth investing in a device with a decent display, a comfortable keyboard, and an accurate trackpad. It makes all the difference when getting into your workflow.</p><p>If you're always on the go, sometimes without your battery adapter, check for laptops that can last long hours on a single charge. Also, if video calls form an integral part of your lifestyle, look out for laptops with great webcam options.</p><p>And because you most likely won't be using your laptop in isolation, you must also think about connectivity. If you are connecting to external hard drives and monitors, make sure you have the right connections on whatever laptop you choose. For starters, you need at least a USB-A, USB-C, a headset jack, and an HDMI port. Otherwise, you might have to invest in a dongle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many other parts make up a computer. And all of them, from the processor to the memory and storage capacity, combine to deliver a certain level of performance. You want to get the right mix of parts, but when you look at a spec sheet, it might initially seem a bit confusing; all the details about CPUs and RAM.</p><h3 id=choosing-the-right-laptop-hardware>Choosing the Right Laptop Hardware</h3><p>The CPU is the power engine of your laptop, with varying capabilities depending on the model. For example, one might manage simple web browsing and Word documents, while another quickly renders 4K videos.MacBooks offer a straightforward processor choice since Apple's shift to silicon chips: the M1 or M2. For PC enthusiasts, Intel or AMD are your main options. The decision isn't easy, so we've outlined specifics for Intel here and AMD here.</p><ul><li><strong>Core i3 or Ryzen 3</strong>: For basic tasks like web browsing and running Microsoft Office.</li><li><strong>Core i5 or Ryzen 5</strong>: For the everyday user, student, and casual gamer.</li><li><strong>Core i7 or Ryzen 7</strong>: For more serious gamers and creative professionals.</li><li><strong>Core i9 or Ryzen 9</strong>: For the professional looking for more oomph.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RAM is essential for lag-free multitasking on your laptop. <a href=#>We have a thorough RAM guide</a>, but the rule is simple: more is better. Start with 8GB, but if affordable, opt for 16GB for seamless performance with multiple running apps.</p><p>Storage is a choice between HDD and SSD. SSD, common in newer models, provides faster file movement and app launching. If cost is a concern, HDDs are a good pick. An SSD is preferred for quick access to filesâ€”essential for gamers or the time-pressed. Finally, choose your storage size. Modern laptops typically start at 256GB, which is sufficient for most. You can boost storage with cloud services or an external drive.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Laptop Type</p></th><th><p>Processor</p></th><th><p>RAM</p></th><th><p>Storage</p></th><th><p>Screen Size</p></th><th><p>Graphics</p></th><th><p>Price Range</p></th><th><p>Notes</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><th colspan=8><p>Intel and AMD</p></th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Entry Level</strong></p></td><td><p>AMD Ryzen 5 5500U</p></td><td><p>8GB</p></td><td><p>256GB SSD</p></td><td><p>13.3"</p></td><td><p>Radeon Vega 8</p></td><td><p>$500-700</p></td><td><p>Good for basic tasks and light gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Mid-Tier</strong></p></td><td><p>Intel Core i5-1135G7</p></td><td><p>16GB</p></td><td><p>512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>14"</p></td><td><p>Intel Iris Xe Graphics</p></td><td><p>$700-1,000</p></td><td><p>Good for productivity and moderate gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>High-End</strong></p></td><td><p>Apple M1 Pro</p></td><td><p>16GB</p></td><td><p>1TB SSD</p></td><td><p>14"</p></td><td><p>Apple M1 Pro GPU</p></td><td><p>$1,000-1,500</p></td><td><p>Good for professional work and demanding gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>High-End</strong></p></td><td><p>AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS</p></td><td><p>32GB</p></td><td><p>2TB SSD</p></td><td><p>16"</p></td><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 6800M</p></td><td><p>$1,500-2,000</p></td><td><p>Best for professional work and demanding gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><th colspan=8><p>Apple</p></th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Entry Level</strong></p></td><td><p>Apple MacBook Air M2</p></td><td><p>8GB</p></td><td><p>256GB SSD</p></td><td><p>13.6"</p></td><td><p>Apple M2 GPU</p></td><td><p>$999</p></td><td><p>Good for basic tasks and light gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Mid-Tier</strong></p></td><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro M2</p></td><td><p>16GB</p></td><td><p>512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>14"</p></td><td><p>Apple M2 Pro GPU</p></td><td><p>$1,499</p></td><td><p>Good for productivity and moderate gaming.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>High-End</strong></p></td><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro M2 Max</p></td><td><p>32GB</p></td><td><p>2TB SSD</p></td><td><p>16"</p></td><td><p>Apple M2 Max GPU</p></td><td><p>$1,999</p></td><td><p>Best for professional work and demanding gaming.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-gaming-a-priority-for-you>3. Is Gaming a Priority for You?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-group-of-gamers-staring-at-a-screen.jpg><p>A decent laptop would get most tasks done efficiently. But if you add some serious gaming to the mix, it might put a strain on a regular laptop's capacity. Plus, certain features make a difference in how long you stay alive in a first-person shooter game or how immersive your experience is while playing triple-A games.</p><p>Most laptops <a href=#>have an integrated graphics card</a> decent enough to stream movies or play low-resolution games. But for the more serious gamer, you need a laptop with a mid or high-end dedicated graphics card, a high refresh rate, and a great display. These combine to deliver an excellent gaming experience. Ultimately, you may want to <a href=#>consider getting a gaming laptop</a> instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-portability-and-flexibility-matter-to-you>4. Do Portability and Flexibility Matter to You?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hp-pavilion-x360-2-in-1-laptop-14t-ek1000-14_.jpg><p>Laptops traditionally come in clamshell mode, which is often the most convenient for typing and gaming. But depending on your work, you might prefer a convertible laptop that can double as a tablet. Those have flexible hinges and often come with touchscreens so that you can use your laptop more comfortably and creatively.</p><p>As for size, think about how much you move around. If you're constantly in transit, you might want a lightweight laptop, easy to slip into your backpack and travel with. Think 10 to 14 inches in screen size and about three pounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But if you're adding this device to your work setup as a desktop replacement, or you just wouldn't be moving around with it as much, or maybe you need the screen real estate for an immersive experience while gaming or editing videos, then 15 to 17 inches sounds about right.</p><h2 id=do-you-want-a-macbook-or-a-windows-laptop>5. Do You Want a MacBook or a Windows Laptop?</h2><p>MacBooks excel in ecosystem integration, design elegance, and reliability. Apple's intuitive macOS and efficient Apple silicon chips deliver a full day's work, and the effective processing of its M1 and M2 silicon delivers remarkable performance.</p><p>Windows laptops, however, offer more budget, spec, and brand options. Typically preloaded with the familiar Windows OS, they provide many software choices and easier component upgrades. This makes them a great choice for tinkerers who want some control in terms of customization.</p><p>Whichever way you swing, make sure you have a general idea of what apps you'll be using the most and confirm they're compatible with the corresponding OS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-long-do-you-intend-to-use-your-laptop>6. How Long Do You Intend to Use Your Laptop?</h2><p>Think about how long you intend to use your laptop. If it's a device that will serve you for years, it's smart to invest in a piece of durable and resilient hardware that won't diminish rapidly in value and performance.</p><p>It's important for two major reasons. One, so your laptop doesn't get outdated quickly. And, two, when you decide to resell or swap it for a newer model, you can still get about 60 percent of the original value. In that regard, Apple hardware generally has better resale value when compared to other brands (it's one of the reasons <a href=#>people pay the so-called "Apple Tax"</a>!).</p><h2 id=choose-the-right-laptop-for-you>Choose the Right Laptop for You</h2><p>The M1 and M2 chips make MacBooks arguably the best lightweight laptops. However, if hardcore gaming is a priority, you'll be better off choosing a gaming laptop with a powerful GPU. They might be a bit bulky and lacking in battery lifeâ€”but you'll be picking performance over anything else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, once factors like budget come into play, and if both the MacBook and top-of-the-line gaming systems are out of reach, you have plenty of mid-range laptop options. Just make sure you choose a laptop with the right mix of parts to deliver the degree of performance necessary for your work. Alternatively, you might be able to buy a top-of-the-line laptop used or refurbished at a fraction of its original price.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiorp2jqbawutJmq6hlkai4bq7En6arnV2Xwrq1zaBkp52nYrmivNOop2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
