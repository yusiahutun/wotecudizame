"It’s CGI.

This should, obviously, be a moment filled with visible love and chemistry. Could that be why fans just weren't seeing it?</p><p>Schulz went on to offer more detail when his co-host expressed incredulity that they would use special effects for a kiss, of all things. With all the expenses in the film, wouldn't it just be easiest to have the two stars lean in and, you know, actually kiss.</p><p>"I’m there, I’m watching the wedding, and I see them go in for the kiss, and their faces stop like this far," Schulz said, holding his hands about six inches apart. "I’m like, ‘I wonder how they’re gonna play that in the movie. Oh, they’re probably just gonna cut right there.’"</p><p>In other words, Schulz had no idea that the filmmakers would go into post and add a kiss with special effects. As he described the final product, "You could see their faces come close, and then you could see their faces morph a little bit into a fake kiss."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e8250b9e-5f04-4920-a7bf-832db0d7f9cd data-container-ref=toofab:article:82031d11-2e1c-47ce-a13d-195379c95274 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f0/5by4/2023/01/29/f03f9c0ca3a44791a2175b87f04d24a4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">HBO</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Last of Us Goes a Whole Different Direction with Heartbreaking Introduction of Bill</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As noted by <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, London herself had expressed concerns that this relationship wouldn't be believable to audiences. She was reluctant to sign on for just that reason, telling Harper's Bazaar, "I thought, ‘Why would these two people really like each other?"</p><p>"We have to showcase a real connection," she continued. "They’re from two totally different worlds, and if you see them, you would never think that they would meet or hang out, whatever the case is."</p><p>Upon its release, fans quickly started to criticize the film and, exactly as London predicted, they did not buy the chemistry between Hill and London. Is that because there wasn't any on the set, either? TooFab has reached out to Netflix for comment.</p><p>Despite the lackluster reviews from fans and critics, "You People" has been the number one movie on Netflix since it dropped January 27, per <a href=#>Insider</a>. The first film from <a href=#>"black-ish"</a> creator Barris, it also stars <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a>, <a href=#>Nia Long</a>, <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>, and <a href=#>David Duchovny</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-7a97848f-d9d7-431e-a323-2fb9657ff4c7 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:7a97848f-d9d7-431e-a323-2fb9657ff4c7 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:82031d11-2e1c-47ce-a13d-195379c95274 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/4by3/2023/02/07/2ed65ff73a154aa0ab4f2e7479adf7de_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaXBfn7yvrcdmn6KknGLGsMGMqZyoqJyaeqy10qxkpZmlp7KvecuopZ2nnmKwqLWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
