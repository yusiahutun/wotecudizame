For over 25 years, the beloved TV program has discovered world-class food talent while inspiring home cooks during their culinary journey.&nbsp;MasterChef&nbsp;begins with a series of heats (each heat being one episode long), features six competitors each heat, and ends with three people moving on to the quarter finals. Once the heats and quarter finals are over, there is Knockout Week, where things get really spicy. Contestants are eliminated until one person is crowned the MasterChef Champion.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>“I believe food brings people together and every year we’re fortunate enough to be able to help incredibly talented, hard-working people realise their dream and indulge themselves in the joy that is MasterChef,”&nbsp;Master&nbsp;Chef UK&nbsp;Judge John Torode told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC One</a>.</p><p>John’s co-judge, Gregg Wallace, continued: “This is when the wave of ambition hits the rock of reality for these amateur cooks – and we are putting them through the most extraordinary challenges we’ve ever seen.

Longtime judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace returned for the 20th season of the popular British cooking competition. “I don’t think either of us believed that when we did the first ever show and we had 96 contestants come through the door, over those 90 days of filming, we would still be here 20 years later, tasting incredible food. It’s always surprising,” Torode said in a recent interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>BBC One</a>.</p><p>Wallace added, “For me, I would say it’s just a wonderful place to be, it’s a fabulous place to be. We’ve been working with really good people for 20 years. I think it’s just inspirational to watch people with incredible talent, reaching for the stars trying to achieve their goals and fulfil lifelong ambitions.”</p><p>When asked whether they find something new from the contestants each series, Torode said they do every year. “Every time I look at these guys, it amazes me. It’s not just the fact that we’ve got food coming from all around the world and flavours and the introduction of new elements, but just watching the way in which people work,” he explained. “You’ve got to admire people’s skills, and they see and learn things in a very different way from each other. I also pick up tricks and tips all the time. I think it’s great. Absolutely brilliant. We’ve even got somebody this year who makes their own plates.”</p><p>John and Gregg will be joined by a variety of guest judges this season. Special guests include 2023&nbsp;MasterChef&nbsp;champion Chariya Khattiyot, past&nbsp;MasterChef&nbsp;champions Jane Devonshire, Irini Tzortzoglou and Ping Coombes, food critic William Sitwell, restaurant critic Jay Rayner, and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-master-chef-uk-contestants>Who are the Master Chef UK contestants?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MasterChef-Contestants-Heat-4.png><p>Who are the&nbsp;Master Chef UK&nbsp;contestants?
