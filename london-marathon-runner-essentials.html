"Prepare the outfit you're going to wear when it’s raining, when it’s not raining, when it’s warm, when it’s cold, so that you have all options and minimise stress on marathon morning."</p><h3><strong>Power Pro Running Bra</strong></h3><p id=eYMpM-xKdH data-wc=25>This Sweaty Betty sports bra is designed specifically for running and high impact workouts, rendered from quick drying fabric with mesh panels for superior ventilation.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da58c115e57d-sweaty-betty-bra.jpg></a><p>&nbsp;<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£65 at Sweaty Betty</p></a><p id=ezRTsKkE_8b data-wc=54><strong>Editor's note:</strong> I have rotated two <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Sweaty Betty Running Bras</a></span> religiously for the last two years, both for marathon training and other workouts. I find the adjustable straps offer far more support than any other sports bra I've tried, and I know I can rely on it on marathon day to keep me secure.</p><h3><strong>Sleek High Rise Leggings</strong></h3><p id=eOWu58Cz3N data-wc=55>The NB Sleek High Rise Leggings are designed to offer the ultimate comfort, both in the gym and on the run. They have a fast-drying technology that wicks moisture away as well as a fold up cuff at ankle to reveal reflective taping - an all-important safety measure that shouldn't be disregarded for nighttime runs.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/be21ecc5b12c-new-balance.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£65 at New Balance&nbsp;</p></a><p id=epQtqNmU8t data-wc=62><strong>Editor's note:</strong> It took me months to find a pair of flattering leggings that didn't ride up or sag at the crotch on long-distance runs. New Balance's leggings have been my go-to for colder days; they're ultra-comfortable, keep me cool and dry and genuinely feel like skin when I'm running in them. If it's raining on race day, I'll be in these.</p><h3>Salomon Active Skin 4</h3><p id=efw9y_WCSZ data-wc=32>Featuring breathable, fast-wicking fabrics, several expandable pockets, hydration flasks and a large back pocket for carrying extra gear, the Salomon Active Skin 4 will be a game changer for you marathon training.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c91060fcbf01-screenshot-2024-04-05-at-083858.png></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£95 at Salomon</p></a><p id=ezCkD3f6zq data-wc=71><strong>Editor's note:&nbsp;</strong>Whether or not you need a running vest for anything other than ultra-marathon training is up for debate, and is a particularly hot topic in the run community. I can tell you that the length of my runs and quality of my training significantly increased when I purchased the Active Skin 4 - and it now comes with me on everything from 5km trots to 20 mile training sessions.&nbsp;</p><p id=erPKV_NbGQ5 data-wc=40>If anything, it's incredibly convenient to hold your phone and keys without compromising your safety on late night runs. It's perfect for storing gels, water and an extra layer of clothing in case you need it in unpredictable weather conditions.&nbsp;</p><h2>What to fuel with during a marathon</h2><p id=eeYN7iCgct data-wc=35>"At this point, you should have your hydration and your fueling down.

Vitals promises to encapsulate 20 nutrients (all the good stuff) into two daily capsules, which is what sold it for me.&nbsp;</p><p id=esJKIUwljPW data-wc=62>I've come to learn that perfecting pre-run nutrition is seriously important. When I first started loading on the training, my immunity took a major hit and I often came down with coughs and colds during my winter training block. I've been taking Vitals for the last few months and I've felt noticeably stronger, healthier and able to go further in my training.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 best probiotics for gut health, plus expert opinion & reviews" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fc6485f93d8d-gut-health-supplements-for-women.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 best probiotics for gut health, plus expert opinion & reviews" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 best probiotics for gut health, plus expert opinion & reviews</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3 dir=ltr>Clif Bloks Energy Chews</h3><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4f09be9a6c2-clif-bloks.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£9.99 at Amazon</p></a><p id=eWY2F6UYxW data-wc=40>Clif Bloks provide a quick and convenient source of energy during training or racing sessions.

I've found they're far more digestible than gels, and taste just as good as any pick 'n' mix sweet.</p><h3>Madagascan Vanilla Organic Whey Protein</h3><p id=eRRC3MayUu data-wc=22>This organic whey protein combines ground vanilla pods and coconut sugar for a delightful creamy vanilla taste with 18.8g protein per serving.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/822358c0d710-organic-protein.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£24 at THE ORGANIC PROTEIN CO.&nbsp;</p></a><p id=e0_QBkjkMGkd data-wc=75><strong>Editor's note:</strong> Long distance running can break down muscle cells and cause damage to the muscles in your legs. Boosting protein intake after exercise can help reverse damage, build muscle, and get you ready for the next distance. I especially love the Organic Whey Protein from Organic Protein Co. because it only has three ingredients; it makes for a deliciously creamy post-run milkshake and doesn't wreak havoc in my gut like other protein brands have.</p><h2>What to use for recovery</h2><p id=eEYhEftVELH data-wc=42>"In the final weeks of training, your body will tell you that you should do more," explains Jeffrey. "You shouldn’t do more. You’ve done most of the work now, it’s time to get back to recharging to be ready for race day."</p><p id=evdcgoe3UT data-wc=15>Recharging and recovery is just as important as training to avoid injury and exercise burnout.</p><h3>Lola Massage Gun</h3><p id=etzxC-r11V data-wc=30>This lightweight massage gun has four interchangeable heads to target all areas of the body, and is ideal for preventing post-run muscle soreness, relieving tension and easing stiffness after exercise.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c2b1458ba3ed-lola-massage-gun.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£79 at John Lewis</p></a><p id=ephFroQWNWD data-wc=58><strong>Editor's note:</strong> I didn't know I needed a massage gun until after I started using one. My ideal long-run day routine ends with a DIY Lola massage to ease up the stiffness I get in my quads and calves after getting in the miles. It's lightweight, near silent, and has a charge that seems to last for weeks.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Are you running the London Marathon?</h3><p id=ePRwHAYj81></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c737bf6654e1-lodnon-marathon-runner.jpg><ul><li>Race-day travel is free for any runners travelling to and from the marathon.
