The speculation aroused since the year 2013 after they were spotted together enjoying dinner at Beverly Hills, California.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=607 style="padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:580px;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:580px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ana de la Reguera and Diego Boneta getting cozy at dinner in Beverly Hills, California in 2013&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: eonline.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Though Diego spelled nothing about his relationship, the&nbsp;source of the duo spoke&nbsp;on their behalf regarding the emerging relationship after a long time friendship. They said: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=608 style="margin-left:auto!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;min-width:250px;max-width:580px;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;display:block!important;min-height:400px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"They already knew each other for a long time and they got along very well, but from what Ana told us, the&nbsp;click&nbsp;between them was given in early September. Then they started going out to eat, to have dinner or just to have a coffee.&nbsp;Went&nbsp;together to the event that&nbsp;Eva Longoria&nbsp;organized in Hollywood through her foundation, in which funds were raised to promote the university education of Latina women.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Despite having the age gap of 14 years between Diego and Ana, the pair had started to give a&nbsp;hint of their relationship. As right after a month of catching them enjoying a romantic night at the Hills, Ana threw a grieving statement,&nbsp;where she mentioned the relationship to be a rumor holding no truth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>“Obviously not.&nbsp;I'm single and always speculate. They're going to see me dating people and they're going to say, but honestly, if I'm going to put up a replica of everything, I'll never finish it.I'm used to people always speculating.&nbsp;So I've always preferred people to talk and that's fine. The truth is always super nice to me, which I appreciate.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, the astonishing statement thrown by Ana created a sense of confusion amongst the fan followers as a source reveals them to be in the relationship after getting caught in an intimated situation. Maybe the pair were in a relationship but were not in conscience to reveal it, or perhaps the duo got a bit tipsy at the dinner in the Beverly Hills, making them get intimated. But at present, the pair is not in a relationship as Ana is dating chef Mario Carbone since the year 2015.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Television Personality:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Tommy Fury Girlfriend, Parents, Family, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Followingly, Diego&nbsp;also got struck by the rumor of dating his co-star Ariana Grande from the series,&nbsp;Scream Queens.&nbsp;Diego depicted the character of Pete Martinez in season 1 while Grande had given a special guest appearance as the character of Sonya Herfmann. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=609 style="background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;padding:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-width:250px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite having a short role of Grande in the screen, Diego got questioned about their relationship,&nbsp;where he justified as,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I'm going to tell you that I love that we're together in the series, and I'll leave it at that."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Ariana said nothing about the raised speculation, for she seems to be currently involved in a relationship with rapper Mac Miller since 2016. In spite of getting acquainted with the rumor of dating several beautiful faces of Hollywood, Diego kept his love life behind the curtain. Interestingly, in August 2019, the actor opted for a different approach to love. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=611 style="width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-width:250px;max-width:580px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;line-height:0;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Though it had just been a few months since he and American Huaso actress&nbsp;Mayte Rodríguez started seeing each other, Diego was not afraid to show his love for the beauty at&nbsp;the Mexican City Airport.

Similarly, the two were snapped spending the summer holidays in Italy in June 2019.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Diego Boneta (middle)&nbsp;with girlfriend&nbsp;Mayte Rodríguez (left) in February 2019</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Mayte Rodríguez's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=612 style="background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:336px;min-height:400px;padding:0;float:none!important;width:580px;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Further, they looked inseparable at the beach in Rio de Janerio in September.

An authentic girl that makes me laugh. A girl that's focused and has a goal&nbsp;someone I can have fun with."</p><p style=text-align:justify>From the confession made by the actor, one can precisely say that he was&nbsp;seeking a perfect woman, so there was&nbsp;a high possibility for Diego to wait for the ideal woman who was supportive as well as loving towards him and his family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=613 style="margin-left:auto!important;line-height:0;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;padding:0;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-width:336px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;text-align:center!important"></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Mexican Man Embraces Hollywood&nbsp;Success</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Born to a Puerto Rican father, Lauro González, and a Spanish mother, Astrid Boneta, Diego encompasses the ethnicity of&nbsp; Puerto Rican, Spanish, American, and holds three citizenship of Spain and the United States.
