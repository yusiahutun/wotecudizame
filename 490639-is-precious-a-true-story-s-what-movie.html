Initially, the book was titled <i>Push </i>but was later re-titled after the release of the 2009 movie. The film is about a 16-years old illiterate, obese, HIV-positive and pregnant girl.</p><p class=align-left>She lives her life in the dark, feeling ugly and stupid. However, later on, she grows into a young girl with poise and self-believe thanks to the dedication and compassion of a few women around her, such as the <a href=#>literacy teacher</a> in Harlem and the social worker.</p><p class=align-left>Whose life is the movie <i>Precious</i> based on? The author drew her inspiration from her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">childhood experiences.</a> Her father, a sergeant in the US Army, sexually abused her when she was eight years old. On the other hand, her mother, a professional nurse, abandoned her at 13.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c780d1c7b0ab8013.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of female Sonic characters: Who is the most powerful?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The author didn't use the story to re-tell her own she underwent more abuse than it depicts.
