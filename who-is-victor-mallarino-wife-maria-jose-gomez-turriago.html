Ironically, his love life was a mess. The actor has been in countless relationships (two of which ended in marriage) before he finally met his current wife María José Gómez Turriago.</span></p><p><span>So, who is María? Keep reading to learn all about her and more.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Victor Mallarino Wife, María José Gómez Turriago?</b></h3><p><span>María José Gómez Turriago is Victor Mallarino’s third wife. Before we talk about her, let’s go through Victor’s past relationships.</span></p><p><span>The actor indeed has a complicated love life. He met the Swedish art director Lotti Haeger when she was studying Film and Television Direction and Production, and married her just a few months later. Then he got a job in Colombia, so they settled in the country on the condition that they would return to London after their first project.</span></p><p><span>However, as offers began to flood in for the actor, the duo ended up staying in Bogotá. Lotti wasn’t happy with this. So, they ended their marriage amicably after having two kids — Sebastián, who is a publicist, and Christina, who is a doctor.</span></p><p><span>In 1993, Victor then found love with actress Angie Cepeda, which was short-lived.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But by 1996, the actor had already walked the altar once again with Kathy Saénz, who was 16 years younger. It seems that the two met when Victor was directing the telenovela </span><i><span>La maldición del paraíso</span></i><span>, but things didn’t prosper between them as Victor was still with Angie at the time.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Victor and Kathy couldn’t even make it to their first wedding anniversary. They divorced 6 months into their marriage due to “incompatibility with a partner.”</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, Victor went on to date multiple partners and finally met María, who swayed his heart away.
