No, Andy Cohen does not have a husband. But he’s been open about having a wedding and his dating life.</p><p>“Not only do I love love, but how fun would my wedding be?” Cohen said in an interview with friend <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaeF3GVBxuQ" rel=nofollow>Anderson Cooper</a>.</p><p>He also revealed that he’s active on the dating apps like Tinder, Raya, and Grindr. “I’ve had some dates, but it’s gotten—in my mind—more emotionally chaotic…because I’m like, ‘Oh my god, I’m not only dating someone, but obviously there’s going to be a point where I’m like, I want you to meet my kids,’” he said on the <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf-YYByUbfA&t=17s" rel=nofollow>Howard Stern Show in 2022.</a></p><p>Cohen’s last relationship was with John Hill. On why they broke up “It was just time,” Hill said on Watch What Happens!, before Andy replied, “We were in different places in our lives.”</p><p>Cohen was recently open about his relationship with Clifton Dassuncao “I haven’t had a lot of long-term relationships,” Cohen said on the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.npr.org/2023/05/18/1176469899/andy-cohen-leila-fadel-talks-daddy-diaries-entertainment rel=nofollow>Not Skinny But Not Fat</a> podcast. “And my last relationship, it was a few years, and it was, maybe ended five years ago. And I kept it under wraps and then a friend of mine posted a group photo of all of us on some boat together and tagged my ex. And the Daily Mail saw it and then did like, Instagram journalism and figured out that he and I had been in the same places a lot and they busted him wide open.”</p><p>Aside from relationships, Cohen has been focusing much of his time to his children. His first child Ben, was born in 2019 to a surrogate, while his daughter Lucy was born in 2022. “I am tired, but I’m really tired because of the kids, frankly. I’ve got the jobs that I have covered. It’s the kids that are the right turn,” he told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.npr.org/2023/05/18/1176469899/andy-cohen-leila-fadel-talks-daddy-diaries-entertainment rel=nofollow>NPR’s Morning Edition</a>. “Everything has changed. My axis has changed. My priorities have changed. The way I live my life every day has changed.”</p><p>He further expanded on how his kids changed his lifestyle <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/andy-cohen-gay-single-dad-lonely-self-doubt-165626141.html>to Yahoo!</a> “It’s a shift, and I think that’s been the gift of having kids late in life,” he says. “When I had my kids, I was financially in a place where I felt comfortable, but I also got to experience being famous for 10 years without having kids. I used to be the guy that had FOMO about missing parties. I wanted to go to the&nbsp;Vanity Fair&nbsp;party every year, and I&nbsp;loved&nbsp;it. It was so exciting. I would fly out for <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1155184/andy-cohen-kris-jenner-rhobh-response/>Oscar weekend </a>to go to parties, and you never knew who you were going to meet. And I’m chill now with all of that.</p><p>“There’s a scene in my new book where it’s Lucy’s first night home, and there were two really fun parties that night that I was invited to, one of which was going to have a ton of super-cute guys, and you know I like a party with super-cute guys,” he added. “But I felt so grounded and whole with myself being at home. I was, like,&nbsp;Wow, this is a family. I have a family, and they’re both here — there’s two little kids here sleeping.&nbsp;And it just felt like I was floating on air, you know? And suffice to say, five years before, I may not have been in that place.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
