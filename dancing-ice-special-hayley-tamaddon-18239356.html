I would have anyway – it’s just now I feel more confident.”</p><p>Fresh from her racy role in the stage version of The Vagina Monologues – a part which Hayley calls “a very sexy show with lots of rude bits” – the babe famous for playing Delilah Dingle says she is not shy about doing whatever her role requires.</p><p>“I had to do a lesbian kiss in Shameless (with Rebecca Atkinson who plays Karen McGuire). The kiss didn’t bother me. Rebecca is beautiful, we just had a giggle. It was great fun.”</p><p>Having shifted almost two stone from her tiny frame for her Dancing On Ice debut, racy Hayley says she is now ready to skate away with the competition, which started on Friday.</p><p>In fact, now she has gone from a size 12 to a six, cute Hayley can’t wait to show off her new body in an eye-popping array of outfits.</p><p>She said: “I wouldn’t have wanted to do the show before losing the weight because the costumes are so tiny and I would have been self-conscious; one of mine is practically a bikini.”</p><p>Hayley hasn’t just been saving the fireworks for the ice rink either. Her hot new bod is being appreciated by her fiancé of five years – choreographer Darren Charles, 36.</p><p>She added: “When I first lost my weight, my body was really toned. I just got in bed and looked down and I thought, ‘I look great’. It just clicked and Darren loved it.”</p><p>One of the bonuses for super-slim Hayley is checking out all the other hot bods on the show – with EastEnders’ Danniella Westbrook and The Inbetweeners star Emily Atack also fighting for the skate crown.</p><p>But it is one of Simon Cowell’s exes who has apparently been stealing the show.</p><p>“All the girls in the show this year have amazing figures, especially Sinitta, whose legs and bum are to die for,” says Hayley.</p><p>Hayley is thrilled to be partnering pal Daniel Whiston – who won the first series of Dancing On Ice in 2006 with actress Gaynor Faye – as she grew up with him in Lancashire.</p><p>She says: “We met when we were 12. My theatre school was behind the ice rink and watched him skate. We’ve been friends ever since.”</p><p>But her ice-capades haven’t been all fun and games. Gritty Hayley has been training at Bradford ice rink every day since October.</p><p>She said: “I’ve had a black elbow, some tissue damage on my knee and I’ve pulled a ligament in my ankle. My most recent and worst injury was that I popped the muscles in my ribs. I did a lift and as I was coming out I heard this massive pop that sounded like I had broken my ribs, but it was the muscle pulling away.”</p><p>Hayley, who admits she used to gobble three chocolate bars a day when on Emmerdale, was inspired to get fit after being horrified at how she compared on screen to the soap’s other female stars.</p><p>She said: “I thought, ‘God I look bigger than the other girls on the show’. I would eat all I wanted to eat really. In the day I would have a sausage bap and chocolate bars.”</p><p>Her body fears came to the surface after an appearance on Soapstar Superstar.</p><p>She admitted: “After Soapstar the press and people on forums were saying there was no way I was a size 10 and that I was lying about it. It was hurtful.”</p><p>After reading the remarks on a TV forum, she broke down. She said: “The odd person is so horrible and it never got to me before. But I rang Darren crying my eyes out.</p><p>“When I left Emmerdale I was a size 12. Even though I was under nine stone, I looked bigger because of my height. You can be eight-and-a-half stone and a normal weight but on the TV you look bigger. It wasn’t nice, but it gave me a push.”</p><p>Now she is match-fit and at her sexy best, and ready to show the doubters how good she looks. But she says this year’s skate-a-thon, won last year by Ray Quinn, will be wide-open.</p><p>“Last year everyone thought from the beginning that Ray was the front-runner but this year it’s really difficult.</p><p>“Gary Lucy is really good on the ice and Mikey Graham and Kieron Richardson are both really good. I think the boys are in front of the girls at the moment.”</p><p>But Emmerdale fans may yet see Hayley reprise her role as Delilah, even though she has worked hard to reinvent herself.</p><p>She said: “I have had to change my look, my weight, my hair, so that people can see the difference and see past Delilah.</p><p>“But if they asked me I would definitely consider going back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLGiusKipaBlmZiybr%2FPnpqimZxitaLFy56wZqyRoq6lsM6nZGpwYmiGdIGV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
