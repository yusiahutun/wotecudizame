After an autopsy was conducted, The Sun <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> the cause of death was declared as multiple stab wounds to the neck and scalp. Additionally, a slit in her throat led officials to conclude she had almost been decapitated.</p><p>A neighbor found both her and Goldman’s bodies at Nicole Brown’s home after being alarmed by dogs barking. Goldman was also declared dead due to multiple stab wounds.</p><p>When first responders arrived on the scene, they discovered her children were asleep in their bedrooms and a bath had been drawn.</p><p>One glove was found at the victim’s home and, paired with blood discovered at the scene, O.J. Simpson became a suspect in the double murder. A second glove was found at his home.</p><p>The sports star’s trial was highly publicized by the media, and the public waited with bated breath for a verdict to be reached. Ultimately, in 1995 he was acquitted of the murder of his former wife after pleading not guilty.</p><p>That being said, in 2008, he was sentenced to 33 years imprisonment on armed robbery charges in a different case, eventually being released in 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-o-j-simpson-passed-away-from-cancer-at-76>O.J.

During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.”</p><p>During an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with The Athletic in 2021, O.J. reflected on his former wife’s passing. “I have trouble with L.A.,” he claimed.</p><p>“People may think this is self-serving, but I might be sitting next to whoever did it. I really don’t know who did this. I figured eventually somebody would confess to something, you know?”</p><p>He added: “I had one suspect I told my lawyers to look at. I still think he might be involved, but I can’t talk about it.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z%2BcLTAq6mor5mjtG6wxK2YoqSjYrynec2imqiklWKvs7vWp2SsoZ2lwLC60maYrqyfpcC6ecCfq56qXZ2ys3nTq5igoZNisaat06Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
