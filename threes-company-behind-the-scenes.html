Suzanne Somers appears in the intro twice</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The sexy, short-shorts-wearing brunette walking along the beach that makes John gawk and fall off his bike is actually a well-known presence on Three’s Company. “That brunette is Suzanne with a wig. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You can tell by her little Suzanne buns</a>,”&nbsp;Ritter said in the book <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three’s Company</a> by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chris Mann</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Joyce Dewitt wanted to quit after 6 episodes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-company_EHFMNI.jpg><p>After taping the first season consisting of only six episodes, Dewitt felt that the producers were pushing her to play Janet as too harsh, and wanted to leave the show if she wasn’t able to evolve the character. Luckily, thanks to her efforts Janet was much more lovable than producers originally intended.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Somers spent her first season salary on this</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/charlies-angels_xCxlCe.jpg><p>Inspired by the success of Charlie’s Angels star Farrah Fawcett, Somers spent her entire first season’s&nbsp;earnings to hire Fawcett’s press manager, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Bernstein</a>, to help make her a star and expand her reach in Hollywood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Ritter hated the episode “Chrissy and the Guru”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-company_EOEG9i-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Mark Richman</a> appeared in three episodes of Three’s Company as Chrissy’s dad, Reverand Luther Snow. Ritter has said that his least favorite episode was “Chrissy and the Guru,” in which Chrissy, the daughter of a minister, fell prey to a spiritual con.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. DeWitt became a spokesperson for L’eggs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-company_10z9ae.jpg><p>DeWitt’s tendency to wear pantyhose even with shorts as Janet — and her ability to show off her dancing skills — paid off when she became a dancing <a href=#>spokesperson for L’eggs</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. ABC bought out a theater to recruit Lindley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-company_Lfdb63-1.jpg><p>ABC so badly wanted Audra Lindley to play Mrs. Roper on Three’s Company, that they paid the L.A. playhouse where she was performing $8,000 — which is worth about $41,000 today — to buy out the entire theater so she could be free to tape the pilot on a Sunday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Richard Kline was punished by producers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/the-love-boat_tftU9E.jpg><p>Richard Kline, who played Jack’s best friend Larry Dallas, was once written out of the show for four weeks for telling producers at a run-through, “I’d like to discuss my character.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. The cast was surprised by sexy Newsweek cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/1978-2-20-Newsweek.jpeg><p>Ritter said he and DeWitt’s “feelings were hurt” when Somers suddenly was chosen to be center focus at a 1978&nbsp;Newsweek&nbsp;cover shoot, but they did’t realize the sexy spin. “All of a sudden it was unusually strange … it was a creepy feeling,” Ritter said. Added DeWitt, “John and I had no idea that the approach to the&nbsp;Newsweek&nbsp;article was a T&A thing.” Somers said she, too, was surprised she was being featured.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Somers was fired for asking for equal pay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-company_vDyjxq.jpg><p>You’d never know based on their on screen relationship, but apparently there were financial tensions between cast members on Three’s Company behind the scenes. According to Three’s Company executive Ted Bergman, John was making $50,000 per episode to Joyce and Suzanne’s $30,000 per episode in the 1980-81 season. When Somers asked for equal pay, she was written off the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Somers wanted to play Jack’s girlfriend in spinoff</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/threes-a-crowd_07I6RF.jpg><p>Somers wanted to be John’s live-in girlfriend in Three’s a Crowd, the short-lived Three’s Company spin-off starring Robert Mandan, Mary Cadorette and John Ritter. But the producers balked. “It would’ve been great,” Somers said. “It would’ve completed the circle.”&nbsp;</p><p>Three’s Company is currently airing on Antenna TV.
