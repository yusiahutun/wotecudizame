"People are more in-tune with picking up on unnatural appearances, like overfilled lips and unnatural jaw lines, and so are wanting to pare it back down." That's not to say there's a return to natural in its literal sense. "The use of filler hasn’t dropped, it’s the overuse that is being corrected."</p><img alt="having filler dissolved" title="Kylie Jenner - having filler dissolved " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-attends-the-2023-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1682335653.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jemal Countess/GA</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dissolving filler feels particularly pertinent when talking lips. As cosmetic doctor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/drsaleenazimri data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Saleena Zimri" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Saleena Zimri</a> tells us, "the increase in the media around dissolving filler can heavily influence the under 35 age group and it has translated to in-clinic requests". She explains that "a lot of women have had lip filler for several years now and alongside aesthetic trends their personal style might have changed; now the lips are looking overfilled and so they want to restart". Shifting focus from volume to definition, "patients are dissolving old filler and looking for a more natural look that's in proportion while defined".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Injectors' techniques have advanced too, as have the fillers they are working with. "We are more in tune with different ethnicities and different age groups; we understand that it is not a one-size-fits-all approach," offers Dr Taktouk. "For example, Teoxane has five different fillers that you can use for lips, because every lip is unique and needs to be treated as such. The beauty ideals and proportions that were once taught to practitioners as gospel are no longer relevant – you can’t apply mathematical ratios to every face." But whether you're looking to start afresh with filler, or stop with it altogether, it's important to know what dissolving filler really involves and whether it's right for you.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Trialling a Sarah Chapman facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-01-16-at-12-27-22-1579177668.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What dissolving filler involves</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/drchristinehall/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Christine Hall" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Christine Hall</a>, who works with Dr Taktouk at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/taktoukclinic/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taktouk Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Taktouk Clinic</a>, explains that not all filler is dissolvable. "It’s only possible with fillers made of hyaluronic acid," she explains. "We dissolve them with an enzyme hyaluronidase, which is a prescription-only medicine that should only be used by medical practitioners."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Some people are allergic to hyaluronidase so we need to do a test injection first," she adds. Indeed, an initial assessment is imperative, feels Dr Taktouk. "Ideally the practitioner who did the treatment should dissolve it, but sometimes the patients can lose confidence in the practitioner who did the treatment, so we do see a lot of patients coming to see us for the dissolving of other practitioners work."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The treatment itself involves injections into the areas where you’ve had dermal filler. "The enzyme breaks down hyaluronic acid and it is then excreted by the body," explains Dr Zimri. But it’s also important to note that the hyaluronidase can’t distinguish between hyaluronic acid in the filler, and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/g28434515/best-hyaluronic-acid-serum/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hyaluronic acid</a> that is naturally occurring in your skin, "so you do lose some of your own hyaluronic acid to a certain extent" cautions Dr Hall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another thing to bear in mind, adds Dr Taktouk, "is you can get bruising and swelling from the treatment with hyaluronidase, which can be a little uncomfortable for some patients".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In terms of outcome, though, "you actually see an immediate result as it starts to dissolve the filler straight away and actually continues to do so for a few days after the treatment before it then stops working," Dr Hall adds.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to know if dissolving filler is right for you</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides knowing exactly which filler has been used on you – should you be seeing a different practitioner to have it dissolved – you need to be over the age of 18 and without contraindications (such as pregnancy).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In general, you are a suitable candidate if you "want to remove filler that you don’t like anymore, or have complications associated with filler such as lumps and bumps or migration of filler," confirms Dr Zimri.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Your options after having filler dissolved</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the easiest option after having filler dissolved is to do nothing, and reacquaint yourself with your unfilled face. Alternatively "you could consider refilling the area with a gentler approach," says Dr Taktouk, "and maybe a better choice of product such as Teoxane, with its patented Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology that gives more natural stretchability, moving with tissues to look a bit more seamless and sophisticated where injected".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Zimri admits that "99 per cent of the time, when a patient has lip filler dissolved, we have to refill". She agrees that the evolution of fillers means that they can now move more with one's natural expressions, stopping the results looking stiff as they might have done in the past (her favourite filler for lips is the RHA KISS from Teoxane RHA's range).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you do go down the refill route, know that it can't be achieved immediately. "We advise one-to-two weeks between dissolving and refill to ensure the enzyme is no longer working and that any swelling has settled," she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Either way, "do your research" says Dr Hall.
