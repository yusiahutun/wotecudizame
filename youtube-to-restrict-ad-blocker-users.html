With YouTube Premium, you can watch videos without advertisements while still supporting independent content creators. YouTube viewers will only have two choices after seeing this warning: turn off their ad blocker and accept adverts, or sign up for YouTube Premium to remove all advertisements.</p><p><a href=#>YouTube</a> acknowledged that the messages are a result of an experiment and urged users to either test YouTube Premium or accept adverts on the website. According to YouTube, which contacted BleepingComputer, “We’re running a small experiment globally that encourages viewers with Ad Blocker users enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium.”</p><p>When questioned if the firm intended to prevent users from accessing the platform if they were using ad blockers, YouTube replied that playback might be momentarily turned off in “extreme cases.” “Playback will be temporarily disabled in severe circumstances where viewers continue to use ad blockers. We take the decision to disable playback very seriously, and we will only do so if users repeatedly refuse to let YouTube adverts in, the business added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p class="responsive-video-wrap clr"></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Not a New Thing</h3><p>Viewers who use ad blockers can turn them off, accept YouTube advertisements, or sign up for YouTube Premium to avoid disturbance during this experiment. The number of participants in this trial and the places where these warnings are being displayed are not disclosed by YouTube. This comes after another “small experiment” in May in which YouTube tried to prevent people who were using ad blockers from using the service.</p><p>At the time, a representative informed Bleeping Computer that “Ad Blocker users detection is not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to disable ad blockers.” According to Variety, YouTube’s Music and Premium services just reached 80 million subscribers after gaining more than 30 million in a single year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMawwdOumZ5lpKR6s7HSramim6RirqV5waWmnKOVp3q2v8Srqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
