She is 58 years old as of this writing.</p><h2>Near-Death Experience When Attacked by a Bear</h2><p>Living in the frigid and unforgiving climate of Alaska, Sue has undoubtedly had several run-ins with death. By far, her closest encounter with death happened in 2007. In a scene reminiscent of the 2015 movie The Revenant, Aikens ran into a grizzly bear and got mauled within an inch of her life.</p><p>Sue recounted the harrowing experience during a sit-down with the Daily Record. In 2008, when Sue was trekking across the Alaskan tundra, she was jumped by a grizzly bear. An adult grizzly can weigh anywhere from 300 pounds to 600 pounds and can stand as tall as 8 feet.</p><p>The bear reportedly had Sue’s head between its jaws, and its teeth were sinking into her skull. She could do nothing as its claws mauled her body. In danger of going into shock, Sue did the only thing she could: play dead and hope for the best.</p><p>The bear left her alone long enough for Sue to retrieve her rifle and shoot the animal dead. After the incident, she had to clean and patch her own wounds, realign her bones, and wait for help.</p><p>When the state troopers found her ten days later, she was miraculously still alive — hanging on to her life by the skin of her teeth but still breathing. She was immediately airlifted into the nearest medical facility and survived the near-death experience with gnarly scars and one hell of a story to tell!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZMC2sYyaoKSdnqh6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
