They started dating in 1997 and split up in 2000 after dating for 3 years.<br>Mandy Willaford (stage name "Willa Ford" formerly "Mandah") is the next wanna be Britney Spears (but we won't go into that one cause that's a whooole 'nother page).<br>Her first song appears on the Pokemon Soundtrack ("Lullaby") and now she's an opening act for the Backstreet Boys (a stupid move on her part). She has an album supposedly with a release date of spring/summer 2000. (God help us all... )<br>Mandah's two-year romantic relationship with Nick Carter, Backstreet Boy is what has made her famous. First she is nothing, and now she's Willa Ford. So Mandy dates Nick gets her record deal and turns into a manipulative, coniving MANDAH. Once Nick breaks up with Mandy he makes a statement about her being abusive and using him. Nick's Statement Once they get back together only two months later (by this time every backstreet fan hates her) she hasn't learned her lesson yet and still continues to be the evil siren everyone believes her to be! Shortly after she dyes her hair and changes her stage name. Hmmm... Why she changed her name<br>At first Nick chose to keep Mandy a secret and told everyone that he was single. When spotted she became "his cousin." (damn wouldn't we love to be his cousin if that's what he does with his relatives)<br>According to Entertainmen Teen magazine, they met through a mutual family doctor. He mentioned to Nick that he knew a girl who was interested in a singing career, gave him Mandy's number and the rest is history. However, there is the other major rumor. The other story goes that Nick and Mandy met through Nick's sister BJ, who was friends with Mandy. They were the same age and both attended East Bay High School in Tampa. BJ allegedly brought Mandy around the house and to BSB concerts, but we don't know if this is true or not.<br>You've seen Nick's ring on his middle finger in pictures, no doubt simple gold band resembling a wedding ring. These rings are a very shady subject. There are even rumors that these rings had something to do with Mandy cheating on Nick, but that has never even come close to being confirmed.<br>Sometime in early 1999 Nick bought a house with Mandy in Apollo Beach, near Tampa, choosing to live with her instead of with his family (who moved to Los Angeles to forward the careers of the younger Carter kids). Nick and Mandy lived in this house for approx. six months, in a gated community offering a higher degree of privacy. This is confirmed--there have been rare pictures of the house and, once, a report by a non-fan who lived in his subdivision that he did indeed live there and was very polite when occasionally spoken to by his neighbors.<br>Nick is currently living in FL with Mandy in the Willaford family house outside of Ruskin (while not on tour, of course). He took his $80,000 Prowler with him. The pair is waiting for their own new house to be finished up so that they can move into it. It is located in Florida, of course. Apparently, this house was purchased in Mandy's name.<br>As for Nick and Mandy's public behavior, they are behaving a little strangely on this tour--we can't exactly figure out what they're doing. They spend a lot of time together and Mandy is often in his room, but in public they tend to walk with at least a ten foot distance between them. We think this might be another "fan duping tactic" to make uninformed fans believe that they are not going out. They ARE together.<br>WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF THE ALTERNATE STORY THAT IS ALSO IN CIRCULATION:<br>Nick & Mandy did not meet through a doctor as that magazine said. They met when she was 15 and he 16 through mutual friends. It was a bunch of friend together and that's how they got to know each other. She was a friend of BJ's and I guess that also helped the relationship grow. However, when they met, she didn't know much about Nick. The BSB were big in Europe but nothing in this country and she didn't realize he was with this soon-to-break group. They have been dating on and off (in other words - have been a couple) for 3 years. Their first real date was when he was 17 and she 16.<br>The Real Deal girls sing her praise because they are thick with her. They are a few years older than M, but they are good friends. She sat with them at the Tampa concert in December and talked her way through the entire concert, except when she left to take the dog for a walk.<br>August 2001<br>Pop singer Willa Ford, 20, and her 21-year-old ex-boyfriend, Nick Carter of Backstreet Boys, who broke up last October after three years of dating, are still friends, she’s told the Associated Press. After all, they share five dogs, with custody divided as follows: Ford has the teacup Pomeranian, a miniature Maltese and a pug, and Carter has another pug and a boxer. “We learned a lot together,” Ford said of her relationship with Carter. “We went through so much at such a young age. We were put in front of all these people so quickly and were so ridiculed.” While dating Carter, Ford was subjected to massive adolescent hatred. (Once in 1999, while opening for the Boys, Ford encountered signs in the mostly young-female crowd that read, “Die Willa.”) “I think at the end of the day, he knows that I caught the brunt of it. Like, I really got the bad part because I wasn’t the boy band celebrity at the time,” she said. “I think he feels bad that it happened.” Meanwhile, reports the Hollywood Reporter, Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell and his wife, Leighanne, have launched their own music label and TV and film production company, Brileigh Prods. “Our main focus is to have fun with it,” Leighanne Littrell said. The Backstreeters resumed their tour on Friday. The boy pop band took a touring break to accommodate group member A.J. McLean’s 30-day rehab treatment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZopaKbm2Kwor7TnqlmmZ6Zeri1y6WYZp6fp7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
