The family soon moved to Los Angeles, where David attended Beverly Hills High School, whose alumni include <a aria-label="Biography of Lenny Kravitz" class=hm-link href=#>Lenny Kravitz</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Angelina Jolie" class=hm-link href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>. "At my high school, it was the norm for kids to get brand new BMWs for their 16th birthday," recalls the 6ft 2in star.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaHm75c9-7g data-wc=84>"I remember going to my dad around my birthday, and I was like, 'Yes, this is it!'. Then my dad had this talk with me, and I wound up driving a big brown 1976 Chevy Impala. I couldn't park the thing it had to be docked. "But high school wasn't all disappointments. Encouraged by the praise of his school drama teacher, one summer David flew off to Chicago for an acting workshop and found his calling. "It was both enlightening and exhilarating," he says.</p><h2>David Schwimmer's career</h2><p id=eGenTHzibNn data-wc=107>After graduating from prestigious Northwestern university, David and a group of friends founded Chicago's Lookingglass Theater Company. He remains a driving force in the troupe, which has since grown in both size and stature, despite his Hollywood commitments. Still struggling to make ends meet, the budding actor shuttled back and forth between Chicago and LA, taking bit movie roles here and there, before landing a part opposite Happy Days hero Henry Winkler in 1993's short-lived sitcom Monty.The following year the team behind Friends gave David a call. They'd remembered him from previous auditions and hoped to cast him as neurotic paleontologist Ross Gellar in their new sitcom.&nbsp;</p><p id=eueTSIK5det data-wc=56>"They were looking for a nerdy Jewish guy," he jokes. "Of course, I was perfect." His on-again-off-again relationship with <a aria-label="Biography of Jennifer Aniston" class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>'s Rachel provided the long-running show, which ended in spring 2004, with some of its best moments both comic and dramatic and earned David numerous accolades including an Emmy nomination and a Screen Actors Guild award.</p><p id=eEQvB6Rcygj data-wc=25>David had something of a comeback when he took on the role of Robert Kardashian in The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>David Schwimmer's personal life</h2><p id=eNqWyiVGk1K data-wc=91>Riding the success of Friends, David once romantically linked to Aussie songbird <a aria-label="Biography of Natalie Imbruglia" class=hm-link href=#>Natalie Imbruglia</a> took roles in some less-than-successful movies including The Pallbearer opposite <a aria-label="Biography of Gwyneth Paltrow" class=hm-link href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and 1998's Kissing A Fool.
