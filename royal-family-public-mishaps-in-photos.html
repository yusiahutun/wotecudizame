The Duchess looked gorgeous as she disembarked the plane, dressing <a class=hm-link href=#>her baby bump</a> in a red Self-Portrait number. But some eagle-eyed fans noticed that she'd made a small mistake with her outfit, by accidentally <a class=hm-link href=#>leaving the return label on the dress</a>. The label could be seen attached from inside the skirt of her dress, hanging just beneath the hem.</p><h2>Princess Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c321e794460-princess-diana-slip-up-in-public-z.jpg><p id=egR9CfIeW48h data-wc=63><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a> fell up the plane stairs in 1991 during a visit to Pakistan. Having slipped and grabbed the handrail to steady herself, Diana's bad day only got worse when her flight was delayed for an hour because of a rainstorm. The windy weather also caused havoc with her wraparound skirt, so we're guessing she was glad to finally get onboard the plane.</p><h2>The Princess of Wales</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/990dedb171af-kate-middleton-shoe-slip-up-in-public-z.jpg><p id=eZLlw-PQ8bS9 data-wc=50>Mistakes happen! Kate grinned as she attempted to pull her heel out from a grate while visiting Mons Barracks Aldershot at the St Patrick's Day Parade in 2013. Holding Prince William's hand for support, the Princess was quickly able to free her shoe before carrying on with the official visit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Queen Elizabeth II</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d58ba857e307-the-queen-slip-up-in-public-z.jpg><p id=eESopNg5ciJH data-wc=59>The late Queen was&nbsp;used to accepting bouquets of flowers, but on one occasion, she&nbsp;struggled to keep control of an&nbsp;arrangement! Her Majesty fumbled with a bouquet while marking the 150th anniversary of the Eton Combined Cadet Force at Eton College in 2010. No doubt one of her aides was quick to retrieve the flowers on her behalf.</p><h2>Crown Princess Mary of Denmark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e55ac1eebd7e-crown-princess-mary-denmark-shoe-public-slip-up-z.jpg><p id=e27DmFIfQTge data-wc=50>Heels can be so tricky! Crown <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Mary of Denmark</a> lost her shoe while visiting the grave site of President John F. Kennedy by the Washington Monument at Arlington National Cemetery.

As they were walking downhill towards the church, Meghan was <a class=hm-link href=#>caught stumbling in her heels</a>, but luckily Prince Harry, who she was holding hands with, was there to save the day!</p><p id=esrq1BRJV_vj data-wc=47>After his wife's near-fall, Harry protectively stopped for a second to make sure she was okay, before they carried on walking to the ceremony. The former Suits actress, who looked elegant and demure in a blue maxi dress, laughed off the near mishap and carried on walking.</p><h2>Queen Sofia of Spain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e9efac363d9c-queen-sofia-of-spain-public-slip-up-z.jpg><p id=e_r-OBt9jUIn data-wc=57>Floor-length gowns and stairs are never a good mix! Queen Sofia of Spain learnt this the hard way when she tripped up while arriving at a state&nbsp;dinner at the White House in 2000. Hillary Clinton could be spotted looking on in concern as President Bill Clinton and Sofia's husband, King Juan Carlos, swiftly helped her up.</p><h2>Crown Princess Mary of Denmark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bdb318eae331-crown-princess-mary-of-denmark-slip-up-z.jpg><p id=ePaHvxumEhaY data-wc=64>Princess Mary of Denmark laughed off a blunder at the Design Awards 2018. The royal was on stage to present the Designer of the Year award to architect Lars Vejen, when the award in the box fell out and landed on stage. The award was quickly put back with the help of the princess, and the group presenting the award laughed off&nbsp;the gaffe.</p><h2>Queen Camilla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01bb44fd3de2-duchess-of-cornwall-slip-up-in-public-z.jpg><p id=e_KKFXRpjT4- data-wc=25>Queen Camilla appeared to need some assistance as she struggled with an umbrella during a windy visit to Wiltshire in 2011.

William and Kate were saying goodbye to their hosts after Shout's Crisis Volunteer celebration event, when the Princess <a class=hm-link href=#>appeared to stumble</a>, as she made her way to the car. Kate kept her composure as her foot slipped out of her Gianvito Rossi heels and even laughed it off with her husband William. We've all been there!&nbsp;</p><h2>Queen Elizabeth II</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b94257a60b9-the-queen-hat-slip-up-in-public-z.jpg><p id=eiOBgJjEyG47 data-wc=53>The <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen</a> didn't often lose her composure, so when she nearly lost her hat in the strong winds while attending a welcoming ceremony with Sultan Qaboos of Oman in Muscatvin in February 1979, it was a moment to remember - particularly when she masterfully caught the escaping headwear and put it back on.</p><h2>Queen Camilla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97b0a789db59-duchess-of-cornwall-slip-up-in-public-hat-z.jpg><p id=ekAuSZPi0wju data-wc=52>The then Duchess of Cornwall didn't realise how windy it would be when she attended the christening of Princess Charlotte in July 2015.
