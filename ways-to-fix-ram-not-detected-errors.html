But that knowledge doesn't mean much if "Ram Not Detected" errors have appeared on your screen. Thankfully, this error is rarely terminal if you know the most common causes and some simple fixes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-ram-detection-errors-normally-occur>When RAM Detection Errors Normally Occur</h2><p>If you have just built your computer or upgraded the RAM, the most likely cause of the "RAM Not Detected" error is the incorrect installation of the modules. This is much more common in Windows or Linux systems but can also occur when upgrading Mac memory.</p><p>Memory detection errors on a computer that was previously working are likely caused by a change in system configuration or software. RAM modules can fail unexpectedly, particularly if overclocked, but this is unusual and shouldn't be your first assumption.</p><h2 id=diagnosing-and-fixing-ram-detection-errors>Diagnosing and Fixing RAM Detection Errors</h2><p>Here are the fixes most likely to work if you are building or upgrading a computer, along with what to check if previously working RAM suddenly fails.</p><h3 id=re-seat-the-ram-modules>1. Re-Seat the RAM Modules</h3><p>When you <a href=#>install a RAM module</a> onto a motherboard of a Windows PC, it's held in place by hinged clips at either end of the RAM socket. The clips help to ensure the memory is seated correctly and prevent the module from working loose if the computer is moved or knocked. If these clips are not fully engaged, the RAM module might not be correctly seated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apple desktops that allow user RAM upgrades employ a similar system of end clips or levers on either side of the memory cage. If these clips/levers are not correctly locked into place, the RAM modules might not be detected.</p><li>Power down your computer and access the RAM socket.</li><li>Release the clips holding the RAM, and remove each module in turn.</li><li>Reinsert the module in the socket and push it firmly into place by applying pressure at both ends.</li><li>The clips will usually engage automatically. Press them inwards, towards the module, to make sure.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ram-sockets.jpg><h3 id=check-for-damage-and-clean-the-electrical-contacts>2. Check for Damage and Clean the Electrical Contacts</h3><p>If you are moving RAM from an old computer to a new one or are using modules purchased secondhand, dirt or damage on the contacts could cause this error.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remove the RAM module carefully and inspect the contacts running along the bottom edge for damage or dirt. The contact plates should be perfectly flat against the PCB and uniform in shape and color.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ddr6-ram-what-we-know-so-far.jpg><p>If the contacts are dirty, gently clean them with a soft, dry cloth. Stubborn dirt can be wiped off with an ordinary pencil eraser. In either case, ensure you wipe in the direction the contacts run. If you have a can of compressed air or one of those mini keyboard vacuum cleaners, it is also a good idea to flush out the motherboard socket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Damage bad enough to prevent the module from working should be easy to see on close inspection. If you find damage, you'll usually need to replace the module. Repairing the contacts on a RAM module is beyond the skill of the average user.</p><h3 id=test-the-ram-in-a-different-slot-or-system>3. Test the RAM in a Different Slot or System</h3><p>If the contacts on the RAM module are unbroken and clean, the problem could be the memory socket on the motherboard. Although it is unusual for RAM socket pins to be missing or broken, it can happen and could prevent the module from being detected.</p><p>Move the RAM module to one of the other sockets on the motherboard. It's also worth trying the RAM in a different computer if you have access to one. If the RAM module works in either case, you have narrowed down the cause of the problem to the socket or a software error.</p><h3 id=double-check-motherboard-ram-compatibility-and-capacity>4. Double-Check Motherboard/RAM Compatibility and Capacity</h3><p>It is pretty difficult to insert the wrong RAM into a motherboard. Different <a href=#>RAM module generations</a> have different numbers of pins and alignment cutouts in varying positions. That makes it impossible for a DDR4 DIMM to fit into a DDR3 socket, for example.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Compatibility problems more commonly occur when the RAM capacity is more than the socket or motherboard is rated for. Inserting a 32GB DIMM into a socket only capable of recognizing 16GB can result in the RAM not being detected.</p><p>The best way to check your motherboard's RAM capacity is by carefully reading the spec sheet on the manufacturer's website. If the RAM you are trying to use is incompatible, you'll need to try to exchange it, buy some new RAM, or buy a new motherboard.</p><h3 id=reset-the-bios-uefi-memory-settings>5. Reset the BIOS/UEFI Memory Settings</h3><p>The BIOS or UEFI in your computer is responsible for several key boot functions, including hardware initialization. It is not unheard of for parts of the boot process to develop errors, particularly after flashing the BIOS or changing settings. In some cases, this can result in RAM not being detected by your OS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The easiest way to fix this is by resetting the BIOS/UEFI. You can do this in several ways, starting with <a href=#>booting into the BIOS menu</a> and looking for the option to Load Setup Defaults or Reset All Settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16-screenshot-showing-the-setting-of-the-usb-ssd-as-the-first-boot-priority-in-bios.jpg><p>If you cannot access the BIOS/UEFI menu, you can try removing the CMOS battery from your motherboard. The CMOS battery, which looks like a large watch battery, is commonly located at the edge of the motherboard. Remove the battery, wait several minutes for any residual power to discharge from the board, and then replace it.</p><h3 id=check-the-operating-system-ram-limits>6. Check the Operating System RAM Limits</h3><p>Each operating system has a maximum amount of RAM it can use. Any more than this amount will not be used and could result in a RAM detection error. If you're using a newer version of Windows or macOS, which allow for 100s of GB of RAM, it's unlikely that this is the problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's how to <a href=#>check the maximum RAM capacity</a> on all major operating systems. If you have more RAM installed than your OS supports, either reduce the amount or upgrade the operating system to a version with a higher limit.</p><h3 id=run-a-memory-diagnostic-tool>7. Run a Memory Diagnostic Tool</h3><p>If none of the previous fixes has worked, it's time to start checking if a faulty RAM module is to blame for the error. The best way to do this is with a memory diagnostic tool.</p><p>Windows users can use the built-in <a href=#>Windows Memory Diagnostic tool</a>. If you're using macOS or Linux, go for something like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Memtest86</a>, which can be run from a bootable drive. Memtest86 is usually the better option, as it's more powerful than the Windows tool and has an interface that makes it easy to see errors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/memtest86-plus-memory-integrity-test-in-progress.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Run your chosen diagnostic tool and check the results in the interface or error log. If it identifies a <a href=#>faulty RAM module</a>, you can remove it and re-check to see if the memory detection error has gone away.</p><h2 id=fixing-ram-not-detected-errors>Fixing RAM Not Detected Errors</h2><p>Experiencing problems with your computer detecting the installed RAM is annoying but rarely terminal. By running through all the fixes here, you can be sure of quickly getting to the bottom of the issue. The most common causes are incorrectly installed modules or a simple BOIS error. Both of these can often be rectified with a few minutes of work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiumrGjYsGwecWir2aqkaJ6r7vTZpuerJWYwaawjJ6pq6eiqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
