ABC is home to shows like The Bachelorette and Jimmy Kimmel Live.</p><p>The official ABC website offers free live TV channels that are ad-supported, not much different from classic TV. This live stream is free to people in the United States. The ABC website also offers a variety of unlocked shows that you can watch free on-demand.</p><p>You also don't need an account to stream from your computer or mobile device; you can start watching right on the website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bbc-channels>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Channels</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bbc-tv-629x500.png><p>The BBC makes all of its TV license-funded TV channels available for free via the iPlayer service. You can watch BBC 1, BBC 2, BBC 4, BBC News, BBC Parliament, BBC Alba, CBBC, and CBeebies.</p><p>Unfortunately, other BBC Studios channels not funded by the license fee (Alibi, Dave, Drama, Eden, Gold, W, and Yesterday) are unavailable. The BBC's international channels, such as BBC America and BBC Persian, are also unavailable.</p><p>If you don't live in the UK, you'll need to use a VPN to watch these channels. We recommend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">ExpressVPN</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">CyberGhost</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cnn>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cnn-670x369.png><p>Many people wrongly assume that it's impossible to watch CNN for free. After all, it's part of most cable providers' premium packages. Even the CNN website only allows you to stream for 10 minutes before asking you to log in with a provider.</p><p>But it is possible. Pluto TV provides the answer. As long as you're in the US, you can stream the domestic version of the TV channel for free.
