He has never had any formal training but he is a very technical person. He even restores vintage cars. He likes putting things together. It's a natural gift," says CEO and managing partner Viviane de Witt. "He implemented a philosophy of high horology, making things that have never been done before."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jerome de Witt's impressive ancestral heritage did not just come from being part of the Bonaparte family. He is also a descendant of King Leopold of Belgium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hailing from an imperial line, Jerome de Witt has strong leadership qualities. He defined a bold vision for the company: haute horlogerie. Jerome de Witt aims to be daringly different and unconventional to manufacture high complication watches. For Jerome de Witt, lending a new spin to a centuries-old tradition of watchmaking is what makes the company stand out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeWitt houses its watchmaking activities inside its 5,000 square-metre manufacture facility. Aside from design, production and quality control processes, DeWitt also has an in-house research and development department. This is where the company manufactures its own movement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The manufacture facility is equipped with modern machinery to develop new watchmaking techniques. Even with the latest technologies, DeWitt still upholds traditional watchmaking techniques such as the guilloche engraving on historical 18th and 19th century rose-engine machines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeWitt unveiled its first exceptional timepiece in 2003, a tourbillion chronograph, the Pressy Grande Complication. Just two years after the launch of its first tourbillion, DeWitt was awarded first prize for innovation at the Grand Prix de l'Horlogerie de Geneve for another tourbillion, the Academia Tourbillon Differentiel. This distinction catapulted DeWitt to the top of the haute horlogerie hierarchy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fuelling the passion of watch collectors worldwide, DeWitt is launching three new watch lines at more economic price points as it celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still embodying the style and quality standards for which DeWitt is known, the new collections will serve as gateways for people who want to own timepieces that are products of the world-renowned Swiss watchmaking legacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeWitt is tailoring new classical lines of watches that are lighter and smaller to match the desires of its customers, particularly the Chinese. Along with the new watch lines, the company will also package its watches in a newly designed iconic box that is recognisably DeWitt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are keeping the DeWitt DNA with the new collection. We want our watches to be more available to many people," says Viviane de Witt. "We are expanding our collection to come across more collectors and other people wanting to acquire a DeWitt watch but could not do so because of the price."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeWitt watches are marketed through the company's extensive retail network across the globe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has points-of-sale in Singapore, Taiwan and Macau. There are also flagship boutiques in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In line with its strategy to attract a wider base of customers, DeWitt is redesigning its flagship boutique in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DeWitt intends to bring the brand closer to customers to share its fervour for watches. The company plans to open new points-of-sale to raise the brand's profile in Asia and to familiarise watch collectors with DeWitt watches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhZ313fphxZp2dp57Btb%2BMoqSpnaKerq150aimratdnru0vMirnGabopqutbXOp2SoqKWhsq%2FAjLCYrZuYmsA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
