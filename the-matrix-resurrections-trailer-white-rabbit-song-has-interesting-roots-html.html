Specifically, Alice’s independent journey in a place that required her to embrace curiosity and a different space felt relatable.</p><p id=par-3_28>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, Slick explained how she wrote the song and how several lines reference psychedelics. She penned it in 1966 after an acid trip.</p><p id=par-4_60>“The 1960s resembled Wonderland for me. Like Alice, I met all kinds of strange characters, but I was comfortable with it. I wrote White Rabbit on a red upright piano that cost me about $50. It had eight or 10 keys missing, but that was OK because I could hear in my head the notes that weren’t there,” she said.</p><p id=par-5_47>Slick added that marijuana, shrooms, and her psychedelic experiences influenced the track, and Ravel’s “Bolero” inspired the melody. “The line in the song ‘feed your head’ is both about reading and psychedelics. I was talking about feeding your head by paying attention: read some books, pay attention.”</p><p id=par-6_45>Further, she explained how lyrics about the Red Queen and White Knight represent social commentary on the powers that be. Jefferson Airplane caught Slick performing “White Rabbit” at a show with her old band, The Great Society, and invited her to join their crew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jefferson-airplane.jpg><h2 id=h-white-rabbit-has-been-in-tv-shows-and-films>‘White Rabbit’ has been in TV shows and films</h2><p id=par-7_54>While “White Rabbit” feels eerily fitting for The Matrix, it’s not the first time the record’s been queued up on the big or small screen. It’s been used in a season 10 episode of The Simpsons (hallucinogens are involved), The Sopranos, Supernatural, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Platoon, The Handmaid’s Tale, and more.</p><p id=par-8_68>Slick and her bandmate Jack Casady told The Guardian they love that the song is used on screen. “It’s always a compliment to see how much the song has been used in films. It’s because you hear White Rabbit and right away you’re sucked into her world – it is like you’re Alice falling through the looking glass,” said Casady. Additionally, they’ve been raking in royalties for decades.</p><h2 id=h-the-white-rabbit-is-a-callback-to-earlier-matrix-films>The white rabbit is a callback to earlier Matrix films</h2><p id=par-9_55>Throughout the Matrix franchise, there are references to the rabbit hole, the white rabbit, and mirrors from Alice in Wonderland. The rabbit became symbolic of a crossroads decision for Neo to step through the looking glass and learn the truth, just like Alice. Coincidentally, her adventure had her return to Wonderland more than once too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_39>The Matrix: Resurrections revives Neo and Trinity for another part of the saga that will either provide final closure or perhaps jumpstart a new future for the franchise. Look for it in theaters and HBO Max on Dec. 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMppitqpmterOx0q6pq52TqbawutJmq6uZmaGys3nWoaCtnV2nrqOuyK1krKeenHqprdJmoKeslaeytMDIp55mqp%2BkwbR6x62kpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
