Here’s what we can expect in this new era that extends for the next twelve months, and how to prepare yourself to have the most bountiful start to truly tap into the Dragon’s hot and fiery energy.</p><p>You want to know a secret? Lunar New Year is a much better time to start your <a href=#>New Year’s </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">resolutions</a>. If you’re anything like me, the resolutions you make on January 1 always seem so tinged with unnecessary pressure and extreme anticipation that we must get it right the first day of the year. Last month for me started out strong. The first week was filled with green juices, long walks and educational podcasts, journaling my tedious inner thoughts on paper, and limiting my doom scrolling on TikTok. Yet by mid-month, life was quick to fill to the brim with unexpected demanding events that veered me off my newfound saintly path. My early morning 6:30 a.m. alarms snoozed themselves into 8:00 a.m., while dry January evolved into a damp one instead.</p><p>Lunar New Year shifts dates every year based on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the</a><a href=#> moon’s 28-day cycle</a>, with the actual day falling anytime between Late January to Mid-February. This year, it kicks off on February 10, which is when we’ll be lucky enough to get a second chance at a clean slate.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.679611650485><h2>The Year of the Dragon 2024, Explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1832463173.jpg><p>“The Year of the Dragon symbolizes energy and favors the bold,” says Laura Lau, a <a rel=nofollow href=#>Chinese </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>astrologer</a>. It’s going to be an extremely popular and lucky year, as the Dragon is the only mystical creature in the twelve animals that make up <a href=#>the </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese</a><a href=#> Zodiac</a>. Collectively, we’re all seeking some fresh vigor and success.</p><p>Each new year holds its own element, which means last year’s Water Rabbit is moving forward towards this year’s Wood Dragon. We can expect a shift toward versatility, creativity, and ease as we embrace the Wood Dragon’s power, virtue, charisma, and innovation. Wood Dragons are incredibly aristocratic, committed, solutions-oriented, and determined. Now’s the time to harvest your inner peace, as well as the seeds you planted last year that have since grown into even more meaningful goals. Together, we can further propel those goals into reality. The Wood Dragon is a fantastic call-to-action, asking you to step up to the plate, execute your dreams, and advocate for yourself and the community around you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-celebrate-lunar-new-year>How to Celebrate Lunar New Year</h2></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>1. Make wishes, not resolutions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1364957450.jpg><p>“Take this two-week period to reflect on the past year and make clear goals for the future,” says Lau. Traditionally, this is a time to get specific and share your wishes with the Dragon without making hard resolutions. Keeping your wishes holistic and open-minded is key to manifesting your next desire.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.82><h2>2. Declutter your physical and emotional space</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1130045127.jpg><p>Just like any fresh start should begin, Lau suggests spending Lunar New Year tying up loose ends and settling debts in your personal and professional life. Wrapping up any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">business</a><a href=#> from the year prior</a> is key to a clean slate.&nbsp;</p><p>As for your home, make sure to declutter as much as possible, focusing your efforts on the door and entryway. “Entrances are especially important because they are the ways good luck can enter a home. Make sure to remove any obstacles to your home, clear away shoes and other items that may have stayed past their welcome,” says Lau. “Also, give the area a good cleaning, both inside and outside of the door, to symbolize a clear entry point for good luck and new energy.” After your thorough cleanse, decorate your door in lucky colors like gold and red or pink and orange for a flourishing start.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.963503649635><h2>3. Enjoy food with loved ones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1488671402.jpg><p>Nothing is a proper festivity without reconnecting with your loved ones over mounds of savory meals. The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, marks the end of winter and continues through the course of two weeks. With the spirit of the holiday anchored in life and newness, cook up simple but delicious meals that satiate while symbolizing health, longevity and exploration.</p><p>For health, noodles are the standard for the representation of a long life. Tailoring the dish to varying taste buds is an easy remedy through sauces. “You can’t go wrong with Chili Crisp Oil or Hot Chili Garlic Sauce from authentic and revered Chinese brands, like <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lee </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Kum</a><a rel=nofollow href=#> Kee</a>, that I grew up with,” Lau recommends. For a quick snack, bowls of oranges (representing wealth) and apples (representing peace) can be found at your dinner table.</p><p>Since most families will be entertaining a large group, you’ll find most dishes are filled with family-style dishes and appetizers like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Scallion Pancakes</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hoisin Shrimp</a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lucky New Year Dumplings</a>. Filling up on traditional foods drenched in tasty sauces is always an exceptional way to ring in the new year, concentrated on abundance and love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrrKivoyonWasmJp6pb7AoKanZWJlf3V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
