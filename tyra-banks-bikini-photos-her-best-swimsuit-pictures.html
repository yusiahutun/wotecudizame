She made history five years later as the first Black woman to land the cover of </span><i><span>Sports Illustrated</span></i><span> Swimsuit Issue. It was just one of her many famous swimsuit photoshoots over her years in the spotlight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tyra landed another cover of </span><i><span>Sports Illustrated</span></i><span> in 1997, sporting several bright neon bikinis in her gorgeous spread. The </span><a href=#><i><span>Dancing With the Stars</span></i></a><span> host announced her retirement from modeling in 2005 at the age of 32. In May 2019, she made her return to modeling, posing on the cover of </span><i><span>Sports Illustrated</span></i><span> at 45. The issue ran 23 years after her first cover.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“There is this stereotype that only a 20-year-old woman in a bikini is hot,” Tyra told </span><i><span>Sports Illustrated </span></i><span>at the time. “Like once we reach a certain age, we are no longer desirable. But I want to show that modeling has no age. I’m coming out of retirement to practice what I preach.”</span></p><p><span>Tyra, who welcomed her son, York Banks Asla, in 2016 via surrogate, celebrated her iconic cover with a body-positive tweet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This is for everybody that has been told that they are not good enough because of their body, their age, their everything,” she wrote on Twitter alongside a photo wearing a yellow bikini. “#BanX is here to tell you that you ARE friggin’ fierce no matter what anybody says!”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In her 2018 memoir, </span><i><span>Perfect Is Boring</span></i><span>,</span> <span>the </span><i><span>America’s Next Top Model</span></i><span> host opened up about facing body shaming early on in her career and how she hopes the modeling industry will continue to evolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m happy that the fashion industry is finally catching up,” Tyra told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in March 2018. “What I’m hoping for is that the</span><b> Ashley Graham</b><span>‘s, the </span><b>Gigi Hadid</b><span>‘s, everyone is just models. Not </span><span>plus, not short, not trans, not curvy. I just want it to be normal.”</span></p><p><span>The former talk show host announced plans to build ModelLand in 2019, a California theme park celebrating uniqueness. Though the opening of the park was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tyra was excited to create a space where people could be themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The modeling industry of the future will not look like what it does today,” she told the </span><a href=#><i><span>New York Times</span></i></a><span> in May 2019. “Anyone with a phone on a camera can be a model. And ModelLand will be a place where you can come and be celebrated and be a fantasy version of yourself.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see Tyra’s gorgeous bikini photos.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tsKuZXZeur7fSZpmio5mjtm68x6irqKtdnbKzecGeqq1lo6y2rr%2FUoqtmqJmYwba%2BxKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
