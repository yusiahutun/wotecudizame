Sponsored by Pepsi, the halftime festivities will be directed by Hamish Hamilton, who oversaw the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London.
The announcement confirms rumors that Timberlake had been in negotiations for the gig and comes despite Timberlake’s role as the “chief flavor officer” for Bai, one of Pepsi’s rivals in the beverage world."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the time, Jackson seemed to catch the lion’s share of the blame for the incident, while Timberlake largely seemed to fly under the radar.</p><p>“I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society. I think that America’s harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people,” Timberlake told MTV in 2006.</p><p>The incident, which became known, inevitably, as ‘Nipplegate’ drew criticism from viewers and scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission, which slapped broadcaster CBS with a fine of $550,000, which was later overturned by an appeals court.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoRwfY9oaWxnmqrAtbXNZquipZKav62typ5knKeem7azucSdZJ%2BnomLAtrzEq2Sbp6ehenZ%2BjKGYpZ6knrqmedKhprBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
