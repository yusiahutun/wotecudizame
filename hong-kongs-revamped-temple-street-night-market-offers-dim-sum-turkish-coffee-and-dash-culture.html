I seldom let my son eat greasy food. But it’s a chance to let him taste something authentic as a Hongkonger,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Visitors heading to the six-month extravaganza can also savour exotic delights, including Turkish coffee, French-style rack of lamb, cuttlefish cakes, signature oyster omelettes and Nepalese grilled meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are also offering some nostalgic things that people have heard about, but may not have been able to try before, such as glutinous rice puddings with red beans, dragon’s beard candy and licorice olives,” Tourism Board executive director Dane Cheng Ting-yat said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Famous Hong Kong night market reopening ‘could be delayed until late November’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan Chi-yan, 63, a resident in the area for three decades, said he had not seen such a crowd for years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s so nice to see the old glory of Temple Street come back.

Organisers have also arranged spaces for vendors to store their stalls and merchandise.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The board said a patrol team was also being deployed to ensure the location stayed clean and to keep noise disturbances to a minimum for nearby residential areas.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Create a mood’: Hong Kong hopes to turn night markets into magnets with bazaars</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We will review the footfall and the reactions of visitors to determine what the next step will be during these six months,” Cheng said. “It’s very important to ensure our residents fall in love with Temple Street and promote it to our visitors.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that the board would promote the night market through creative videos on social media platforms such as YouTube and mainland China’s Xiaohongshu, where vloggers could also share their own first-hand experiences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bazaar is also collaborating with architect Stanley Siu Kwok-kin and displaying illuminated art installations in 11 locations. The pieces include nods to the neighbourhood and Chinese culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside the night market, the century-old Tin Hau Temple Complex, a declared monument, will extend its opening hours every Saturday from 5pm to 10pm to promote the city’s culture and heritage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZon6iml2K4sLrGZpycp56kurp7wKuropucmnx0fpNuaW9uX528r7OMpKann6Niv6bCwKannpxdqbKuvMueZKysopqytXnNop6hrF2irrO3xK1kqJ6Wmr%2B0ecOipGarpaJ6tcHRpKCsoF2YvKeyxJ5kmqaUYrGiv8dmmq6kpKq%2Fpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
