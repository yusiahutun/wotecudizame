At the time, his wife claimed the two were walking together outside around 3:00AM when they were attacked by a man who took her husband's life in brutal fashion.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WPSD 6</strong></a>, "the victim's organs were no longer in his body" and both his hands and head were almost severed from his body. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>At the time of her arrest</strong></a>, police said they did not believe any male attacker existed, however, and took Cocina into custody, charging her with her husband's murder.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:74f17fc8-875c-4c53-b8bd-9137d87b80ea data-container-ref=toofab:article:ed388900-7f4b-41cb-81ba-1b663ac921d5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b5/5by4/2023/12/14/b5998cfe627248de9020973af76c7b82_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Corona Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Who Killed TikTok Star, Date and Heard Voices Before Fatal Movie Theater Shooting Found Sane</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During her trial this month, doorbell footage was shown to the jury in which someone appears to be chased by another person while screaming, "Baby, no! Baby, no!" Witnesses testified the person screaming was Robert.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>You can see the video here.</strong></a></p><p>A man who claimed he was having an affair with Cocina at the time of her husband's murder also testified, claiming she asked him whether he knew anyone who could "bump off" her other half. Text messages between the two were also shown in which she said of her husband, "I hate his ------- guts ... it won't be long. I'm hoping I'll eventually find somebody, you know, you know what I mean. And then he'll be gone."</p><p>Prosecutors argued she then took matters into her own hands and killed her husband herself.</p><p>"Some strange robber didn't take out his breathing tube, didn't slash his carotid artery, didn't almost decapitate him, didn't take his wrist down to the tissue," Prosecutor Chuck Walter said during the trial. "This is not a 20-year murder, this is not a 30 or 40 year murder. This is life in prison."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bb8e715a-a63c-44d0-8490-58325b31071e data-container-ref=toofab:article:ed388900-7f4b-41cb-81ba-1b663ac921d5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5c/5by4/2023/12/13/5c866b7234a14ff7bcf9b3c2b2296734_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Cape May County Jail/GoFundMe</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">NJ Man Who Decapitated Mom Was Found Nude Laying on Top of Her Body: Police</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Last week, Robert's son Kevin gave an impact statement in which he called his late father his "best friend."</p><p>"It's destroyed me personally," he said of his father's murder. "I don't know so much about my other brothers and sisters. I do talk to them, but it's destroyed me, and I'm sure it's destroyed them too."</p><p>The jury deliberated for about an hour last Thursday, requesting to see the doorbell footage again before delivering their guilty verdict. They also recommended a sentence of life in prison; her sentencing will be in January.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f671b995-e922-4ce1-ab9c-a2d2fb17e4bd data-container-ref=toofab:article:ed388900-7f4b-41cb-81ba-1b663ac921d5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/74/5by4/2023/12/09/74f9c24fdf1a45fe888aa0e45e81a867_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Brevard County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Who Shot Ex-Girlfriend 15 Times After She 'Ignored His Calls and Texts' Sentenced</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmanBfmLyktc2aZKmdnqN6qMHIpauyZZiqwKOtzZ1kpq2imbKzedGipaBllqS8ta3GnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
