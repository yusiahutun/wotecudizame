Not the Sukanans, though. They view the appearance of the snake as a good omen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having an angel snake come to your home is a blessing,” explains Aree Sukanan,the daughter of the elderly man under whose bed the snake had hidden, and mother of the boy who discovered it. “My father dreamed about a snake and the next day we found the snake under his bed.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">When a cobra appears, your wish will be granted.Nulam Paipanom</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Thai villagers call king cobras “angel snakes” and believe them to be manifestations of supernatural beings. They credit the reptiles with magical qualities, including the ability to appear and disappear at will and to turn into human beings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They think the snakes can bestow wealth and good health on people. “Since the angel snake came to us things have been improving,” says Aree, who owns a rubber plantation. “My business is better and I’m feeling less tired.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In recent years, several other families in the village have had similar experiences with cobras. Local environmentalists aren’t surprised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Snakes are losing their natural living spaces to people,” says Nonn Panitvong, a conservationist who runs a group on social media aimed at educating Thais about snakes coming into their homes. Each year, he says, tens of thousands of such serpentine visitations take place around Thailand, involving numerous species, from harmless tree snakes to deadly monocled cobras.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Snakes enter houses to hide or look for food,” Nonn says. “People often kill them on the spot.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Malaysia’s ‘snake whispering’ firefighter dies after fatal bite … and no, he didn’t marry a cobra</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Residents in Namaipai tend not to harm the snakes, however. They believe visiting cobras are a sign of impending good fortune. Some families have even erected shrines to them, and ply the serpent statues with offerings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/06/bbbd1900-3954-11e8-b7a4-1972cdd9f871_1320x770_190709.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We ask the angel snakes for their help,” says Sommard Marurat, an octogenarian who has set up one such shrine featuring two wooden king cobra statues. “We’re not afraid of king cobras.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They don’t bite us. They only come to warn us or bring us luck. If I see one, I wai to him respectfully,” he says, referring to the traditional Thai greeting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such respect for king cobras is common. Across Thailand the snakes have long been dreaded and revered in equal measure. The mythical Naga serpents whose images adorn local Buddhist temples are frequently depicted as seven-headed king cobras.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Buddhist lore, once when the Buddha was immersed in meditation a giant king cobra appeared and spread its hood over him to shelter him from the elements.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">When I have some extra money, I like to get a shot of snake blood. It’s better than Red Bull.Thai motorcycle taxi driver</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many Thais believe that the spirits of the serpents communicate with them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes the Cobra Queen appears in my dreams,<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">”</strong> says Yupin Saoklang, a petite woman who works in a Bangkok factory. “She tells me to pay my respects to her … If I don’t do that for a while, my luck begins to run out.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So Yupin makes sure to frequent the Shrine of the Cobra Queen, a sanctuary in Thonburi, a district of Bangkok which is dedicated to an angelic being who worshippers believe can take the form of a female king cobra.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yupin is there on a recent Sunday morning, along with dozens of others who have come to present offerings to a large effigy of the ferocious snake. The stylised cobra is crowned with a golden tiara and covered in gold leaf. It’s surrounded by countless statues of other hooded cobras, their heads raised and fangs bared threateningly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Piling up on stone tables before it are numerous trays of eggs and whole chickens. In return for these gifts, worshippers ask for favours: a better job, a new partner, a win at the lottery. Some of them write their requests on pieces of paper, which they fold and place in the effigy’s snarling mouth along with banknotes as further enticement to grant their wishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/06/c4743844-3954-11e8-b7a4-1972cdd9f871_972x_190709.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve heard if you lose money, you can get it back after you petition the Cobra Queen,” says Somchai Kuno-pahad, 65, a taxi driver who is here for the first time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Somchai says he lost a large sum of money recently when someone withdrew money from his bank account with a fake ID. “The police don’t want to help me,” he says. “Maybe the Cobra Queen will.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bordering the shrine on one side is a plot of land overgrown with thick tropical vegetation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The site is home to several live cobras. Visitors can watch them come and go from a ground-floor window. Momentarily a grey serpent slithers out of the thick undergrowth to nose around eggs thrown to the ground as offerings. Then another cobra appears and disappears. Then another.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When a cobra appears, your wish will be granted,” says Nulam Paipanom, 49, an office worker who travelled here from a nearby province. “We believe in the sanctity of this shrine. If wishes weren’t granted, why would so many people keep coming here?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/06/cb8c2af6-3954-11e8-b7a4-1972cdd9f871_1320x770_190709.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the story goes, years ago when a nearby road was being built through a patch of greenery, a female king cobra appeared in a dream to the driver of a bulldozer. She pleaded with him to halt construction so she could bear her offspring in safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The workers didn’t heed her plea and accidentally killed her hatchlings. In revenge she began killing the men and their loved ones in a series of freak accidents. To placate the vengeful serpent, locals built her this shrine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It would seem then that you kill a cobra at your own risk. Yet, nearby, some other Thais are about to do just that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a wire-mesh hutch in the Bangkok neighbourhood of Klong Toei, cobras coil in listless heaps in the afternoon heat. One fawn-coloured cobra raises its head and flicks its tongue inquisitively. Today, the snake is on the menu.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Troops drink cobra blood in US-Thailand war games</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cage is at a mobile food stall where men sit on folding chairs at plastic tables. They’re here not to worship cobras but to drink their blood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A server hooks the inquisitive serpent with a fire iron and plucks it out onto a table. Disoriented, the cobra bobs and sways. Suddenly the man smacks the snake from behind. The cobra sputters and spreads its collar in warning. He slaps the irate reptile again. He does this to get its blood up. Adrenaline pumping furiously through a cobra’s veins is believed to make the medicinal properties believers attribute to the snake’s blood more potent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The outlet’s owner is an elderly Thai-Chinese man with a clouded eye, who is standing at an aluminium table with surgical instruments on it. A sign pinned to his pickup truck reels off ailments that cobra blood allegedly cures or alleviates: impotence, lethargy, cirrhosis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/06/9da91bee-3954-11e8-b7a4-1972cdd9f871_1320x770_190709.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His attendant ties the snake up by its neck, causing its forked tongue to protrude piteously. The old man wraps a handkerchief around the cobra’s head and wipes the snake down with a wet cloth. He seems almost affectionate. He then takes a scalpel and slits open the cobra’s abdomen. As its blood drains into a tumbler, the snake twitches fitfully and goes limp.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The old man adds some whisky to the blood, and hands the cocktail to a customer. “When I have some extra money, I like to get a shot of snake blood,” explains the customer, a motorcycle taxi driver. “It’s better than Red Bull,” he adds, referring to the popular energy drink.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Isn’t he afraid of the Cobra Queen’s revenge? “No,” the man says after some thought. “I don’t think this was an angel snake.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLa4066pnmeRp8Gqr8ueZmtpZGWCdX6OpKCnn12YvKO%2BwKxkraCRnrmiusNmrqGxXai8rrGMr6ClpJGcsrO%2FjLCmq6uYnr1uv82aop5lkaOxbrvToZyrq12Zv6q6ymagras%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
