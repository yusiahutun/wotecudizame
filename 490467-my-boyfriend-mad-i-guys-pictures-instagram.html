It is perfectly okay to feel jealous when you are dating someone. Therefore, they get mad as a way of <a id=https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/partner-liking-instagram-pictures-other-people href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">handling the feeling</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The boyfriend might develop insecurities that impact their self-esteem as they are likely comparing themselves to the other person. But giving them a reason as to why you liked the photo can ease things and make them feel comfortable.</p><p class=align-left>In most instances, liking another guy's photos is no big deal. You might have liked the image because they are your close friends, a co-worker, like your photo or used to like your pictures before your relationship and many other reasons.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, whether this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hurts your boyfriend</a> relies on your boundaries, the type of photos liked, and the people whose pictures they liked.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9602959a720d52af.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ cute comments for your boyfriend's pic on Instagram</span></p></a><h2>Is it OK for your girlfriend to like other guys' Instagram pictures?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c40d3895fb189324.jpg><p class=align-left>Relationships have different dynamics, and there is no straight answer to this question. However, you can judge it based on different scenarios, and it would make better sense.</p><h3>Do they like a picture of someone they know?</h3><p class=align-left>Of course, liking a photo of someone you know or an acquaintance on Instagram is no biggie when you are in a relationship. It is only when your girlfriend's interest in someone on Instagram appears more than a <a href=#>friendship</a> that you should feel weird or get mad.</p><p class=align-left>Relationship gurus state that it wouldn’t be fair to expect your girlfriend to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stop liking</a> other people's photos or looking at them just because you are in a relationship. It is an unrealistic expectation.</p><h3>Does your girlfriend like pictures of an ex?</h3><p class=align-left>It is one thing like liking a random guy's picture on Instagram and liking that of their ex-boyfriend if they are dating now. Of course, it might be okay and not okay, depending on your mutual understanding.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b5df34d57cffd12.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>200+ best compliment words for photos on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The best way to address this is to address it directly and express feeling uncomfortable about it in the first case. Your partner might think it is acceptable, but you have a different opinion. Therefore, it is a good idea to trade carefully when approaching this matter.</p><h2>Is liking pictures on Instagram cheating?</h2><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that being in a relationship nowadays is more complex than it used to be. Along with the common insecurities in a relationship, you must now worry about what your partner posts or likes on social media. So, the biggest question has always been, "is it cheating when your partner likes other people's <a href=#>photos on Instagram</a>?”</p><p class=align-left>It is a general conception that liking another person's pictures on Instagram is not cheating, and many people subscribe to this ideology. However, some people might get sensitive about it and get mad. And that is why it is always a good idea to communicate in a relationship and get common ground on these matters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 tell-tale signs she has moved on to someone else already</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Today, Instagram and other social media platforms are so common that one needs to be open to these uncomfortable conversations to know what is acceptable in their relationship. You might find it disrespectful, but your girlfriend doesn't see a big issue. Therefore, communicating will help solve the underlying problem.</p><h2>What should you do if they never like your Instagram photos?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9602959a720d52af.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the biggest questions has always been, “What should I do when a girlfriend likes other guys' photos on Instagram but not mine?” Such an instance can be confusing as you might not know how to interpret it. It is assumed that your girlfriend is meant to be your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">biggest fan</a>, but it might feel like a betrayal if they don't like your photos. Is this a bad sign?</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes, it might be that their <a href=#>social media</a> usage is poor and when they go online, they like a few photos and leave, and probably yours never came into view. Therefore, before freaking out, consider their digital frequency.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a32fe3edefacb293.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>130+ best flirty comments for your crush's pics on Instagram</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another reason can be that your social media interactions could be better, and she hardly comes across your social media posts. As always, the best way to solve this is to talk about it and express your worry. Inquire why they do not like your photos and that it hurts they don't interact with you online.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, you should also watch out for red flags. If you have talked to them about it and have informed them to like your photos and they stay away excessively, it could be a red flag. Why are they hellbent on not liking your post or pictures? If they cannot provide a valid reason, something else is likely going on.</p><h2>Your girlfriend follows random guys on Instagram</h2><p class=align-left>Is it a red flag if your girlfriend follows random guys on Instagram? Yes and no. They might be looking to increase their social media presence and are just following people that come on their timelines. After all, there is no way of dictating Instagram's algorithm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/91edb2a38d27f5ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ awesome profile pic comments for Facebook for your friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, if the trend is too much, there might be a problem, and the best thing is to talk about it to find out what is going on. If your girlfriend alleviates the red flag by giving a valid reason, well and good.</p><p class=align-left>Ladies have always wondered, “What should I do when my boyfriend gets mad when I like other guys pictures on Instagram?" The simple reply is to talk about it, let them express themselves, and find common ground. Jealously is expected in a relationship and their reacting to liking other people's posts on social media is part of the complications of a relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for black couple goals that will make your love stronger?
