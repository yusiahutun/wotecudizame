It's important to know how it works, how it differs from sharing your phone's connection, how fast your car's internet will be, and what to expect before paying up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are several benefits to having Wi-Fi in your car. Many people think of it as a connection for tablets and laptops on a road trip, but that's just one of many benefits. Here are the basics and what you need to know.</p><h2 id=how-in-car-internet-works>How In-Car Internet Works</h2><p>Getting Wi-Fi in your car is similar to using Wi-Fi at home, and you connect the same way with a Wi-Fi name and password. The only difference is your car uses a cellular signal like your smartphone. Homes have an internet receiver that transmits to nearby devices through a router, and a car does the same. So while your house likely uses a dedicated ISP, often with hardwired cables, vehicles connect to the internet through a cellular data connection.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Tech You Can Upgrade Your Car With</a></span></p><p>Keep in mind that a car Wi-Fi router won't be as powerful as the one you use at home, but they're more than strong enough to send out a signal to surrounding devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can get internet from your vehicle while sitting in the back seat or at a park bench as long as you're close enough to the car. Many systems can transmit the internet up to 30 feet away.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-in-car-internet>How Much is In-Car Internet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f443ade2.jpg> Tesla<p>Most new cars come with a free trial for internet connectivity because many people realize how great it is once they've had it for a few months and end up buying it. Without a trial, most would skip it and use a phone hotspot instead.</p><p>Thankfully, the price of in-car internet is relatively affordable, although it varies based on vehicle type, internet speeds, and the features you want or need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Car internet typically runs between <strong>$10-$50 per month</strong>. For one of our staff members, her Subaru was around <strong>$35 a month for unlimited data</strong> with 4G LTE speeds. Most vehicles support the latest dual-band technology, plus allow several devices to connect at a time. Optionally, you can get more affordable in-car internet if you don't need unlimited data.</p><p>Depending on the manufacturer, you may be able to buy weekly, monthly, or yearly internet plans. Adding in-car internet for a week during a family road trip, for example, is a great idea. Plus, did you know you don't even need a new car to get Wi-Fi? Some brands like AT&T <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">offer add-on modules</a>.</p><h2 id=how-fast-is-in-car-internet>How Fast is In-Car Internet?</h2><p>The speed of your car internet will vary due to several different reasons, and it may not reach the same internet speeds you get at home. For one, you're in a moving vehicle instead of sitting at a desk or the couch, plus the signal gets blocked a bit by the vehicle frame and roof. That said, expect speeds similar to a smartphone while you're in a moving vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a car receiver and router probably won't be as powerful as the one in your home. They're smaller and aren't connected to a wall outlet with unlimited power. Instead, it'll offer a combination of speed and performance without putting too much strain on the electrical system and battery.</p><h2 id=it-s-not-just-for-laptops-and-tablets>It's Not Just For Laptops and Tablets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/874a99fc.jpg> BMW<p>Streaming Netflix on a tablet in the backseat is perfect for traveling with kids, and having in-car internet could certainly make getting work done on the go easier. However, those are just a few of the many benefits available.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most people think of car internet as a means of entertainment, but it's much more than that these days. A prime example is Tesla, which uses an internet connection to stream TV to passengers, play games, <a href=#>sing karaoke</a>, or issue <a href=#>updates and fixes for recalls</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is Tesla So Interested In Gaming?</a></span></p><p>Many new vehicles come with an entire suite of connectivity features and services. Some of those include connected parking, built-in maps that are constantly updated, digital car keys, emergency services, or work alongside GPS tracking.</p><p>And we can't forget about the remote over-the-air software updates. As cars get smarter and go all-electric, we're seeing more and more brands take advantage of always having power and internet. No one wants to get a recall and have to take a day off work, drive to the dealership, wait forever, and eventually get their car fixed.</p><p>These days, many automotive manufacturers can push updates, new features, or patch recall notices directly to the vehicle in a software update while you stay at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-car-wi-fi-worth-it>Is Car Wi-Fi Worth It?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2c643aab.png> <a href=#>Chesky/Shutterstock.com</a><p>Car Wi-Fi is absolutely worth the money. As we said above, having internet or Wi-Fi in your car is good for more than just entertainment on laptops or tablets. Being able to get over-the-air software updates for recalls, upgrades, or new features on the latest Tesla, and more importantly, emergency services support makes it totally worth it.</p><p>Having a subscription to in-car Wi-Fi is perfect for personal and business use, navigation, keeping your eyes on the road instead of a phone, software upgrades, maintenance, and even reliability. These days there are more reasons to have it than ever before, and we see more with each new car that comes out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've also noticed that the internet in some cars can get a signal when our phones can't. This is because the cellular data receiver in a vehicle is bigger than the tiny one inside your phone and may be able to pull a signal while you're in a remote location, on an outdoor adventure, or traveling and need directions.</p><p>As you can see, multiple reasons can justify spending a little extra money each month to get in-car internet. Especially when you can get daily, weekly, or monthly plans. Ultimately though, it's up to you and your family whether it's worth it or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoamhiaIRwtdJmmpqqXay2brLIZq6oqqSdeqrAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
