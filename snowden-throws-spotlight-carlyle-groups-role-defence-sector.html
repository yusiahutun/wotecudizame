Federal investigators are examining how Snowden, who worked at an NSA facility in Hawaii and had also worked for the CIA, was able to gain access to sensitive information.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carlyle declined to comment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Booz Allen, has been a fixture in the Washington area for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defence and intelligence agencies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It paid US$2.54 billion for Booz as a deep recession took hold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business, which has offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, was spun off to become Booz & Co, leaving Carlyle with a government-only company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new Booz Allen Hamilton established an incentive-based compensation structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firm's success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorised to speak publicly, "you got to eat what you killed".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The incentives helped spur profits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Everybody has a responsibility, depending on your title, to bring in a certain amount of business," said William Loomis, managing director at financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Booz Allen Hamilton, which employs 24,500, had a net profit of US$219 million on revenue of nearly US$5.8 billion for the fiscal year to March 31. During the same period in 2010, the year the company went public, it earned US$25 million on US$5.1 billion in revenue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carlyle has cashed in on the increased demand of Booz's services. As profits and revenue have grown, Booz Allen has borrowed money to pay dividends to shareholders, including Carlyle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carlyle collected nearly US$550 million in dividends in 2009 alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, Booz Allen issued another special shareholder dividend valued at US$765 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Booz Allen went public in 2010, and Carlyle now owns around 69 per cent of the total shares outstanding, valued at about US$1.66 billion.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Leak puts Carlyle Group in spotlight</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2Z%2Fd32PcWloq56kxKWxzWaroaqfrMBuv8%2Boq6Whl53Bbq%2FAq6OypJVitLO71KmqZqqfobJusMSfnKeblWLApq%2FTqKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
