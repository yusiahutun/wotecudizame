Since there are so many different types of pore vacuums available online, it can be hard to figure out which ones are worth buying. We scoured thousands of reviews to find the pore cleaners that shoppers say actually deep-clean skin and remove blackheads. Some of the most high-end options on this list also function as at-home microdermabrasion tools, while the more affordable ones typically only have vacuum suction. Overall, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Freeshow Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum</a> proved to be an effective, affordable option with a variety of suction levels and probes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about the seven best pore vacuums you can buy online, from top-rated brands like PMD and Dermaflash.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-freeshow-blackhead-remover-pore-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freeshow Pore Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freeshow Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GcGCMJarvRrynfIpeYSRYGRUTJ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freeshow-blackhead-remover-pore-vacuum-eabe6e76a6d94338a16e23dd496e73ce.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Freeshow Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum has amassed nearly 10,000 four- and five-star reviews for its all-encompassing package that makes obliterating blackheads easier than ever. The top-selling pore vacuum comes with five probes in varying sizes to address multiple skincare concerns, including clogged pores, oily skin, and fine lines and wrinkles. Each of the probes can be used with five different suction levels, though remember, it’s best to start off on a lower level until your skin is used to the suction. Additionally, if you’re someone who likes your skincare gadgets to match your aesthetic, you’ll be glad to know that this tool comes in seven colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>5 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>LED screen and rechargeable battery</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-exfoliating-pmd-personal-microderm-classic></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Exfoliating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PMD Personal Microderm Classic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PMD Personal Microderm Classic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WQ6SXr7Q6pnPETfWJkQ55W_v5y0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PMDPersonalMicrodermClassic-8ffd6f5860b044a9a2575546b26be654.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>In addition to unclogging pores, this pore vacuum works to reveal softer, smoother skin, too.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It has to be plugged in.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This at-home microdermabrasion device from PMD, which is beloved by over 12,000 Sephora shoppers and is one of board-certified dermatologist Dendy Engelman, M.D.’s top picks, uses spinning crystal heads to exfoliate skin and vacuum suction to boost elasticity. There are four different levels of exfoliation, ranging from ultra-sensitive to moderate, so you can use the tool on various skin types and gradually work up to the higher options. It's available in six different colors (including various shades of pink and purple), and each comes with two cap sizes: a small one for your face, and a large one for your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Word of warning here is to not overdo it as you can over-exfoliate and disrupt the skin barrier — especially if you’re also using exfoliating face washes and retinols,” Dr. Engelman says. With that in mind, consider using this device with smooth, creamy, non-exfoliating washes for gentle yet effective results. Make sure you also have accessible outlets, as it has to be plugged in when in use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>1 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Hygienic face cap and multiple exfoliation discs</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spatula-dermaflash-dermapore-ultrasonic-pore-extractor--serum-infuser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Spatula</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dermaflash Dermapore Ultrasonic Extractor & Infuser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermaflash Dermapore Ultrasonic Pore Extractor &amp;amp; Serum Infuser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I-KK6Y3KIwAQzHMRgJPgzTffm3o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermaflash-dermapore-ultrasonic-pore-extractor--serum-infuser--d9506c9e73e343ae9936145073a75ec3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dermaflash is probably best known for its dermaplaning tools, but the brand also makes ultrasonic skin spatulas — a.k.a. a type of pore cleaner that facialists use for painless extractions. Even though it doesn't technically have a suction effect, it still unclogs your pores and removes blackheads using ultrasonic vibrations, which is why Dr. Engelman is such a big fan. “This device quickly unclogs pores and enhances the penetration of your favorite serums, masks, and moisturizers,” she says. The brand recommends keeping your face wet throughout the process, so make sure you're near a sink or damp towel. After you try the extraction mode, there's a second vibration mode that's designed to evenly spread serum across your face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>0 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Water-resistant and cordless</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-camera-prabensei-blackhead-remover-pore-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best With Camera</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Prabensei Pore Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Prabensei Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Y37PWvo_FIuFN3BJaiZJ8aKGIMs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/prabensei-blackhead-remover-pore-vacuum-e5e97179f35941b8888f26fb2e246a8f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Prabensei</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Dr. Engelman doesn’t think it’s really necessary to see your pores magnified, she admits that there are camera-enhanced pore cleaners that are popular and effective nonetheless. “The Prabensei Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum allows you to see your pores up close with the device’s built-in camera, which allows you to enlarge the surface of your skin by up to 20 times,” she explains. By enlarging your pores, the device can help you pinpoint problem areas while steering clear of less affected facial zones, so you’re less likely to irritate your skin. Just be wary that if you have sensitive skin, this suction’s power is intense and can lead to temporary bruising if not careful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>3 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>7<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Camera and WiFi capabilities</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-microderm-glo-diamond-microdermabrasion-machine-and-suction-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Microderm GLO Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Microderm GLO Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine and Suction Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rnduQrXKRhRQf9ygk0J7Os4Gx00=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MicrodermGLODiamondMicrodermabrasionMachineandSuctionTool-cf53d925441249b783c9a928e1573767.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This high-tech pore vacuum by Microderm Glo is gentle yet powerful, and noticeably clears skin after one use. Whether you’re a seasoned pore-sucking pro or a beginner, the wireless device displays a diagram that guides through each step of the microdermabrasion and suction treatments. And since there are three different suction powers, you can adjust the settings as needed depending on how congested or sensitive the area of your face is. This pore-cleansing vacuum is on the pricier side, but the brand also makes a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">more affordable version</a> with fewer bells and whistles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>3 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Wireless with Guided LCD screen</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-spa-sciences-mio-diamond-microdermabrasion></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spa Sciences MIO Microdermabrasion</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spa Sciences MIO Diamond Microdermabrasion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/P1fJn7Fi7DFIsdTEFMgknFU8h_Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SpaSciencesMIODiamondMicrodermabrasion-770daea9d3f74f23b5e94317f1528a7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At less than $30, the Spa Sciences Mio is an incredibly great value because it's practically two devices in one. Unlike most of the other affordable options on this list, the Mio functions as a five-speed pore vacuum and microdermabrasion tool. The diamond tip smooths out the surface of your skin, and the various suction tips suck up debris from your clogged pores. It also comes with 20 foam filters, which the brand recommends replacing after each use. (You can <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">order another pack of filters on Amazon</a> when you run out.) If you’re new to pore vacuums, we recommend trying another product, though, as the suction power on this one can be intense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Suction Levels: </strong>5 |<strong> Probes Included: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Wireless and rechargeable</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-lcd-screen-umickoo-blackhead-remover-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best With LCD Screen</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UMICKOO Blackhead Remover Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UMICKOO Blackhead Remover Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qd3NKVBYNDYZbOp0TfprE2tOX6E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/umickoo-blackhead-remover-vacuum-4e3a1ffccf224b999280acf3f7aa0f2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>The LCD screen indicates the chosen cleaning mode, allows you to pick the proper suction based on what needs to be removed, and clearly showcases a timer for the treatment.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The UMICKOO Blackhead Remover Vacuum is one-of-a-kind thanks to its very intuitive LCD screen that pinpoints everything from the cleaning mode and suction level, to the treatment duration and remaining battery life. The rechargeable device operates with three suction levels and comes with four face probes to achieve the deepest clean.

"A higher suction level does not mean a more effective treatment," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Ife Rodney, M.D</a>., board-certified dermatologist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Eternal Dermatology</a> in Fulton, MD. "Pore vacuums may damage the skin on higher settings, causing bruising and even long-term discoloration.” Look for devices with more than three adjustable suction levels and different replacement suction heads (like our best overall pick <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>Freeshow Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum</strong></a>, which has five suction levels and five heads). More levels means they will have milder settings and you can gradually work your way up to the right balance of suction.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Probes</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the shape of the probe, the pore vacuum will be able to address different complexion concerns. Where probes with smaller openings work best for the face, those with larger holes help better address skincare concerns on the body. Additionally, ovular probes help to tighten and cleanse the skin while larger circular probes can better tend to oily and clogged T-zones. Generally speaking, pore vacuums come with various probes, along with explanations for each.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Special<strong> </strong>Features</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vacuuming out your pores may not come as second nature. As such, it helps to have a pore vacuum with special features. Where a cordless design ensures easy maneuvering, a magnifying camera can help make it easier to target congested areas of your complexion. (<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>Prabensei Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum</strong></a> has the best camera in our opinion.)

“First, they can create micro-abrasions in the skin; this leads to skin irritation and impaired barrier function,” she warns. “Damaging the skin barrier can worsen acne, exacerbate eczema, and cause post-inflammatory pigmentation.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you manage not to trigger breakouts, Dr. Kobets says that it’s very easy to accidentally overdo at-home pore vacuuming, which can lead to bruising, which while not technically unsafe, can certainly be unsightly. “Melanin rich skin can also have a higher risk for PIH (post-inflammatory pigmentation) from the trauma of suction,” she adds.</p><p

recommends some at-home pore vacuums, at the end of the day, she says that the safest and most effective way to deep cleanse pores is with an in-office DiamondGlow facial. “DiamondGlow utilizes a skin-resurfacing device that uses ‘3X1™ Technology’ to exfoliate the skin, extract impurities, and infuse skin with advanced SkinMedica® Pro-Infusion Serums tailored to address different specific skin concerns—all at once,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html

rel=nocaes>SkinSpirit</a> Lead Aesthetician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Karen Fernandez</a> agrees that DiamondGlow is the way to go. “If you are trying to ‘fix’ acne or correct oily, large-pored skin, you will want to come every two weeks for a series of three to six treatments,” she says. “Doing treatments closer together when in ‘corrective’ mode will prevent the skin from going back to its original state and having to essentially start-over every four to six weeks.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp

a pore vacuum on active pimples because you run the risk of spreading oil, debris, and dirt across the face and to other pores,” Dr. Kobets says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp

blackheads. “Pore vacuums are effective on open comedones like blackheads and sebaceous filaments, but not for closed comedones or deep-rooted acne and especially on irritated or inflamed pimples,” she explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading
