He walked up to accept his award, and viewers expected the usual signs of gratitude when a <a href=#>celebrity</a> reaches the microphone. However, this <a href=#>Emmys Award </a>throwback saw Glenn switch it up because he followed his heart, instead.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-glenn-weiss-cute-emmys-moment-will-go-down-in-history>Glenn Weiss’ cute Emmys’ moment will go down in history</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1035172202-683x1024.jpg><p>Perhaps when Glenn Weiss was named at the Emmys as the winner, fans thought he’d thank his family, the crew of the show or even host of the night Jimmy Kimmel. But no, he chose to go down the emotional route instead.</p><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> director explained to people watching at home his mother had sadly died only two weeks before the big night.</p><p>Weiss then turned to his girlfriend, Jan Svendsen, in the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> audience, and this is when the magic happened.</p><p>Glenn Weiss started his Emmys speech with: “Mom always believed in finding the sunshine in things, and she adored my girlfriend Jan.</p><p>&nbsp;“Jan, you are the sunshine in my life, and mom was right, don’t ever let go of your sunshine.”</p><p>After calling Jan the ‘sunshine’ in his life, he said: “You wonder why I don’t call you my girlfriend?</p><p>“That’s because I would like to call you my wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-you-marry-me>‘Will you marry me?’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Jan’s reaction was just as shocking as the question itself. Her mouth wide open, stunned, she clasped her head in her hands in disbelief. The other <a href=#>movie</a> and television stars in the audience screamed with excitement. Jan then wipes tears away from her eyes as she holds her hands up.</p><p>Jan then went up to the stage as the crowd erupts with applause to meet Glenn. He then jokes, ‘he didn’t ask yet’ when she murmurs yes. That was his turn to get down on one knee, hold out the ring his father had given hi smother 67 years before, and propose.</p><p>There wasn’t a dry eye in the house.</p><p>Of course, before his proposal, Glenn did thank people from the crew and host of the Oscars quickly at the start. But the essence of his speech was to pay tribute to his mother and his partner, Jan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-are-glenn-weiss-and-jan-stevenson-now>Where are Glenn Weiss and Jan Stevenson now?</h2><p>The loved-up couple did get married, although it took five years.
