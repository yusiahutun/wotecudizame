We spoke with Myka Meier, the founder of etiquette consultancy Beaumont Etiquette, about the products the British royal is said to use.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Kate Middleton has been photographed wearing tights with non-slip grips on them</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To prevent her feet from slipping out of her heels, Meier said Middleton wears non-slip tights from John Lewis, a high-end department store in the United Kingdom. The sheer stockings retail for £6, or around US$6.50, and feature gel strips on the bottom of each foot that grip to the soles of shoes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/27/7201df79-00f4-4cf2-9f99-1c9ead0c0edc_7f18be7b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As leading shoe magazine Footwear News reported in 2017, royal fans previously spotted a photo of Middleton seemingly wearing the tights while on a royal tour of Canada in July 2011. The photo shows clear, gel-like strips peeking out over the side of the Princess of Wales’ pointed-toe Tabitha Simmons heels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Middleton also wore the shoes while visiting Sainte-Justine University Hospital in Montreal on the third day of the trip. Representatives for John Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Kate Middleton’s favourite outfits, and her habit of re-wearing them</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">The Princess of Wales is also said to use leather insoles</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meier also noted that Middleton has been known to wear Alice Bow insoles created by British designer Rachel Bowditch. According to Alice Bow’s website, the slip-in leather soles are designed to cushion your feet so you can comfortably wear any type of shoe, including high heels, for hours.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, an unnamed source told Vanity Fair’s royal correspondent Katie Nicholl that Middleton had “ordered a couple of packets” of the Alice Bow insoles. “She thinks they are great,” the source said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time, a spokesperson for Alice Bow told Vanity Fair that the company could not comment on “talk of the duchess wearing [its] insoles”. “We have seen a massive surge in site visits, however,” the spokesperson added. Representatives for Alice Bow did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">There is no official protocol that dictates what footwear royals should wear</h3>According to royal expert Victoria Arbiter, the late <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Queen Elizabeth</span></a> set a strict precedent about wearing stockings in public during her 70-year reign.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You never see a royal without their nude stockings,” Arbiter previously said. “I would say that’s really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the queen requires.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/27/6dc25a37-d21c-4d93-b6b1-2f087dcfdaf0_88448ea7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meier added that British royals typically follow that guideline while “performing their royal duties in their professional roles”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same goes for their shoes, with royals making sure to choose “appropriate” footwear for the occasion, like Middleton wearing “sneakers and flats at more casual or athletic-themed events”, Meier said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpwbHFlbnysrdOeZKahlJm5psDOp2ShmaNif27A0aKapKtdrLKivsinnmagmZy1brTEnqOsZZikwrO%2FjJ6lnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
