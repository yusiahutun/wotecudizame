Singer and keyboardist Christine McVie passed away peacefully at the age of 79. Reports stated that the musician – who co-wrote heyday hits “Little Lies”, “Everywhere” and “Songbird” – died peacefully in hospital on the morning of Wednesday, November 30, 2022, while surrounded by her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/26f2074d-89cb-43c9-b29b-b980d4e66260_de4e203d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fans are celebrating the singer’s long run, her time with Fleetwood Mac, and the fortune she left behind. Inducted into the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame back in 1998, the group has seen members switching in and out, with a total of 15 different musicians over the years. But here are the five faces fans remember as truly defining the classic line-up … and how much they’ve banked (according to the number crunchers at Celebrity Net Worth).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, which member of Fleetwood Mac is the richest as of 2022?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is the richest Beatle?

As the group’s co-founder and bandleader, 75-year-old Mick Fleetwood can looks back on an extraordinary music career that’s warming its way into its sixth decade. While his main music responsibilities lay with Fleetwood & Co., he also holds a solo music career, has published written works, and has also dabbled in acting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the successful streak in multiple fields, Fleetwood’s net worth is a comparatively slender US$30 million – although that’s in large part due to financial mismanagement. The drummer has opened up over the years about how he squandered his fortune, telling The New York Times he spent a large portion of it on drugs, impulsive business investments and properties. Rock star shiz, in short.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/8551a69d-2055-430f-bad3-e7ceeddf5ef9_eda8c26d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mick eventually recovered from his losses and addictions and his net worth built up to what it is today. But there was one habit he couldn’t let go off – his impressive car collection. GQ conducted a deep dive into his known motors, including vintage buys like an Austin 7 (1933), Bristol 401 (1951), Cadillac Eldorado convertible (1964) and Ferrari 274 GTB (1966), as well as cars that are a little more modern like the Porsche Carrera 2002.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How did Lisa Marie Presley lose all the Elvis millions?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4.

It’s often said that the “Mac” in the band’s name was added just to entice McVie to join the band. He arrived just in time to record the band’s first album in 1968, rocketing Fleetwood Mac into rock history under early leader, blues guitar great Peter Green.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike the rest of his bandmates, McVie didn’t venture out into a solo career or side gigs and he kept most of his work within the group. He released one solo album in 1992, John McVie’s “Gotta Band” with Lola Thomas. With his work sticking to his band more often than not, McVie’s net worth is stated to be around US$50 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/81ffc963-c860-4d6f-8262-8d1621edb1bc_04c5bf7a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it’s not known how McVie likes to spend his dollars, according to Trulia he bought a US$6.8 million four-bedroom in the same area where his bandmate Lindsey Buckingham lives.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is the richest member of rock band Queen?

Her soulful vocals and piano were a key component of the group and helped define the classic Fleetwood Mac sound.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born Christine Anne Perfect, she was originally brought into Fleetwood Mac as a session musician in 1968 – the year she married the band’s bassist and became the brand’s second “Mac”. The couple divorced eight years later, but McVie stayed in the band – and kept the name even through a second marriage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">McVie also wrote and co-wrote some of the group’s best tracks including “Little Lies”, “Everywhere”, “Don’t Stop”, “Say You Love Me” and “Songbird” – eight of which made the group’s bestselling 1988 Greatest Hits album – before stepping away from the band in 1980, only to rejoin a number of times, finally returning for good in 1998.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">McVie had collected several awards and achievements during her active years, which included the Gold Badge of Merit Award and Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/524d07a5-4fda-4142-b4e0-2827a8488aa0_c98dc12f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With a dazzling music career, it’s no surprise that McVie boasted a net worth of US$105 million at the time of her passing. She also had a luxury London flat which she put on the market in 2018 for US$4.4 million.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">9 richest The Voice coaches of all time: net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2.

The rock icon has opened up in past about her out-of-control drug habit, estimating she spent over US$1 million on cocaine, after becoming addicted to drugs, alcohol and sleeping pills when she was 27. This habit of hers got so bad that it reportedly burned a hole through her nose. “There was no way to get off the white horse and I didn’t want to,” she admitted in the biography Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams & Rumors by Zoe Howe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/6f61ab47-7043-47ef-bbfe-d72fbb9164d5_18723064.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After getting rid of her life-threatening habits and showing the world her talents as a solo artist with a string of smash 1980s albums, Nicks was named one of the 100 greatest songwriters of all time by Rolling Stone, and became the only female artist who has her name stamped in the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame twice, after being inducted as a solo artist in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She’s maintained her poise and relevance with smart collaborations with a younger generation of musicians, including Miley Cyrus.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Miley Cyrus’ rumoured new stepmum Firerose, who may be younger than her</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.
